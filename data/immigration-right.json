The first case occurred Oct. 16, when a van approached the U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint on U.S. 59 east of Freer. A K-9 allegedly made a positive alert during the immigration inspection of the occupants. Agents referred the van to secondary inspection.  Further inspection of the vehicle resulted in the seizure of over a pound of marijuana, more than 2 grams of methamphetamine, and 59 Xanax pills, according to Border Patrol. A passenger, who was a U.S. citizen, was arrested on drug possession charges. Duval County Sheriff’s Office investigators took him into custody.  A second case took place about two hours later near the City of El Cenizo. Agents said they observed the several people carrying bundles across the Rio Grande. As agents responded to the area, the suspected smuggler dropped the bundles and swam back to Mexico.  Agents seized three bundles containing approximately 220.24 pounds of marijuana with an estimated street value of $176,192. The Drug Enforcement Administration took over the case.

Some universities are planning to offer classes entirely online because of concerns about the pandemic. The new rule could be devastating for students and universities alike.  One lawsuit, filed by 18 attorneys general against the Department of Homeland Security, calls the new rule a “cruel, abrupt and unlawful action to expel international students amidst the pandemic that has wrought death and disruption across the United States.”  The Trump administration issued the new immigration policy last week, as it seeks to force universities and K-12 schools to reopen in the fall despite soaring COVID-19 infections across the country. The lawsuit highlights a July 6 tweet from President Trump declaring: \"SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!\"  The new rule, issued by the immigration and customs agency, is a reversal of the federal government's policy in the spring, when international students were allowed to attend online-only classes as colleges abruptly closed campuses because of the pandemic.  The shift has enraged many educators and lawmakers, who say the new rule threatens to upend careful planning by universities and wreak havoc for the approximately 1 million foreign students who attend American colleges each year.  University of the Pacific joined a coalition of 20 universities including University of Southern California, University of Oregon, Oregon State University, Arizona State University and Stanford in suing to block the policy.  “This new federal regulation is an attack on our international students and higher education,” Pacific President Christopher Callahan said in a news release Monday. \"It is outrageous, and we will do everything in our power to ensure the academic success, safety and security of our international students.\"  In fall 2019, 8.5% of Pacific’s student body came from countries outside of the U.S.  \"It makes absolutely no sense and actually takes away from the vibrancy and the energy of our colleges and universities, because our international students bring a unique perspective to the classroom and really enrich the educational experience for everyone,\" said Gary Locke, the former governor of Washington State who is now interim president of Bellevue College.  Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who leads the lawsuit by the state’s, seeks an injunction to stop the rule from taking effect while the matter is litigated. Healey filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, along with attorneys general from Colorado to Michigan to Wisconsin. Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology filed a similar challenge last week, which was supported by several other universities.  Healey said the rule would force schools to choose \"between keeping their international students enrolled and protecting the health and safety of their campuses.”  Under the new Trump administration policy, international students enrolled at institutions that offer classes entirely online in the fall would need to transfer to a school that offers a hybrid of online and in-person classes — or leave the country and take online classes from their home countries, Carissa Cutrell, acting ICE deputy press secretary, said last week.  She defended the policy, saying students could engage in remote learning \"as any other student would at that school,\" but from their home countries.  Critics say that argument ignores the reality that many international students would face significant barriers to online learning in their home countries. They would be in different time zones and may not have reliable internet access, among other problems.  The Trump administration's reversal could be a major economic blow to colleges and universities, as well as the communities surrounding them, because of the loss of tuition and other revenue from international students who typically pay full price.  The number of international students studying in the U.S. reached 1.1 million in the 2018/19 academic year, according to the Institute of International Education, and they make up 5.5% of the total U.S. higher education population.  International students contributed nearly $45 billion to the U.S. economy in 2018, according to data from the U.S. Department of Commerce.  But it's not just a question of economics. International students bring new perspectives and diverse cultures to campus life, enriching academia in vital ways, colleges say.  The new rule \"will be severely detrimental to the education of thousands of international students and will cause long-term damage to the world’s view of our country and our openness to talented students from everywhere,\" Robert A. Brown, president of Boston University, said in a statement supporting Monday's lawsuit.  The lawsuit argues the new policy imposes substantial harm on schools and students and alleges the Trump administration's actions are abuse of authority and a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. That 1946 law governs how federal agencies make and enforce regulations.  \"Our international students deserve the full opportunities and experiences of a Pacific education no matter where they are or how they are learning,” Callahan said. “As we prepare for the fall semester, we will work closely with every affected international student to help them achieve their educational goals and dreams.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 11, "positive": 44, "negative": 11, "joy": 1, "anger": 27, "surprise": 8, "fear": 11, "trust": 11}, "metadata": ["trump", "usa", "washington", "district", "sued", "donald", "students", "united", "online", "devastating", "attorneys", "homeland", "unlawful", "expel", "pandemic", "immigration", "seeks", "lawsuit", "tweet", "customs", "government's", "colleges", "american", "university", "coalition", "southern", "arizona", "regulation", "christopher", "ensure", "massachusetts", "injunction", "harvard", "institute", "protecting", "in-person", "deputy", "defended", "barriers", "internet", "administration's", "economic", "typically", "education", "economy", "boston", "imposes", "abuse", "enforce"]}, {"text": "Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary and Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro speaks at the J Street National Conference in Washington on Oct. 28, 2019.

I’m so proud of everything we’ve accomplished together. I’m going to keep fighting for an America where everyone counts—I hope you’ll join me in that fight,” Castro said in a statement on Jan. 2.  Castro, 45, was the U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development during the later years of the Obama administration. He joined the University of Texas at Austin’s LBJ School of Public Affairs in 2017 after leaving that position.  He announced his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination on Jan. 12, 2019.  Castro released a video on Twitter on Jan. 2 announcing the end to his candidacy, highlighting some moments on the campaign trail.  “I’m so proud of the campaign that we’ve run together. We’ve shaped the conversation on so many important issues in this race, stood up for the most vulnerable people, and given a voice to those who are often forgotten,” he said.  “But with only a month until the Iowa caucuses, and given the circumstances of this campaign season, I’ve determined that it simply isn’t our time. So today it’s with a heavy heart and with profound gratitude that I will suspend my campaign for president.”  Democratic presidential candidate and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro (C) and his family arrive at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, Iowa, on Aug. 9, 2019.

Castro is one of a slew of Democratic candidates to call for decriminalizing border crossings, which immigration experts say would lead to a flood of new migrants. Castro traveled to Mexico in October 2019 and took to the Texas border a dozen people who said they were exceptions to President Donald Trump’s “remain in Mexico” policy for migrants.  The 12 people were sent back to Mexico later that day.  Castro struggled in recent months to raise enough money, threatening to drop out of the race twice in the fall amid looming debate qualification deadlines. He didn’t qualify for the December debate and wasn’t expected to qualify for the upcoming four debates in early voting states.  Castro’s exit from the race follows that of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.). Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg both entered the race late in 2019.  The rest of the field includes former Vice President Joe Biden, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii).  The Iowa Democratic caucuses will be held on Feb. 3.

Hier wird gerade eine Strasse in den Fels gesprengt, mitten in der Wüste von Arizona. Bald sollen hier Baufahrzeuge die Grenzmauer errichten.  Die Mauer ist im derzeitigen Wahlkampf nur noch am Rande ein Thema. Doch Trump treibt den Bau stetig und kompromisslos voran.  Die Schneise wird durch ein Naturschutzgebiet gesprengt. Der Guadalupe Canyon ist Lebensraum für seltene Vögel und Wildtiere. Dem bedrohten Jaguar wird so eine mögliche Route von Mexiko in die USA verbaut. Die Bauarbeiten führen auch durch Ruhestätten von indigenen Stämmen.  Für Schmuggler und Grenzgänger, die sich illegal im Gebiet aufhalten, ist das Gelände jedoch denkbar ungeeignet: Temperaturen von über 40 Grad Celsius, keine Strasse, keine Wohnsiedlungen, in denen sie untertauchen könnten.  Marie-Astrid Langer, USA-Korrespondentin: «Mit dem Mauerbau mitten im Niemandsland will Trump wahrscheinlich Stärke beweisen. Und dass er seine Versprechen einhält, egal, wie gross die Hindernisse sind. Seine Kritiker wiederum behaupten, der Präsident wolle sich mit der Mauer vor allem selbst ein Denkmal setzen. Arizona hat als einziger Grenzgliedstaat keinen Einspruch gegen den Mauerbau erhoben.»  Hier lässt man die Regierung einfach gewähren. Die Grenze führt auch mitten durch die Stadt Nogales.  Marie-Astrid Langer: «Ich stehe hier an der mexikanisch-amerikanischen Grenze in Nogales. Also auf der einen Seite der mexikanische Teil, zu meiner Rechten in Sonora, und der amerikanische Teil hier, auf dem ich stehe, in Arizona. Es ist wirklich nur einen Steinwurf entfernt. Ich höre die Leute nebenan singen, auf der mexikanischen Seite.»  «Die beiden Städte, oder besser gesagt die beiden Stadtteile, sind seit Jahrhunderten eng miteinander verwachsen. Im Jahr 1995 dann errichtete aber die amerikanische Regierung unter Bill Clinton die Grenzbefestigung, die man hier hinter mir sieht.»  Unter Trump wurde die bestehende Grenzmauer in der Stadt mit massivem Stacheldraht verstärkt. Die Menschen hier leiden unter der durch Corona ausgelösten Wirtschaftskrise.  Unzählige Geschäfte haben seit Monaten geschlossen. Die Grenzstadt Nogales wirkt wie ausgestorben. Verstärkt wird die Krise durch die restriktive Grenzpolitik unter Trump.  Amerikaner dürfen zwar nach Mexiko, aber Mexikaner nicht in die USA. Der einseitige Grenzverkehr macht vielen Menschen von Nogales zu schaffen.  Mann am Grenzzaun in Nogales: «Sie ist meine Frau. Sie ist zwölf Stunden von Sinaloa hierhergefahren, nur um meinen Sohn zu sehen. Nur für zwei Tage. Und es ist fünf Monate her, seit ich sie das letzte Mal gesehen habe.»  Ein Mann in Nogales: «Die Mauer ist nicht gut, denn sie schwächt die Wirtschaft.»  Eine Frau aus Nogales: «Wir hatten mexikanische Besucher hier, Touristen, Geschäftsleute und so weiter. Und umgekehrt. Ich spreche von vor Covid-19. Wir haben die Veränderung bemerkt. Es waren weniger Leute, weniger Leute kamen rüber.»  Ein Mann an der Tankstelle: «Ich will für Trump stimmen. Ich denke, das bedeutet mehr Sicherheit. Mehr Arbeit, wenn sie die Mauer bauen. Ich denke, das bringt mehr Arbeitsplätze.»  Marie-Astrid Langer: «Den einen kann Trumps Mauer überhaupt nicht hoch genug sein, weil sie Kriminelle und Gewalt aus Mexiko fürchten. Die anderen wiederum trauern der Zeit nach, als die beiden Nogales noch eins waren.»  «Für sie spiegelt sich Trumps feindliche Haltung gegenüber Mexiko in just dieser Mauer. Vor vier Jahren gewann Trump hier knapp. Der Staat wandelt sich, die Bevölkerung wächst schnell. Migration und Immigration prägen den Gliedstaat.»  Inzwischen gilt Arizona als heiss umkämpfter «Swing State». Derjenige Präsidentschaftskandidat, der Arizona gewinnt, hat gute Chancen, am Abend das Rennen in ganz Amerika zu machen.  Unbeirrt von der hiesigen Krise, treibt Trump den Mauerbau in Arizona weiter voran, Meter für Meter wird die bestehende Mauer verstärkt und der Weg für neue Abschnitte in den Fels gesprengt.

I am a typical white American from a typical Midwestern city. As a teenager, probably the most unique thing about me was my fascination with Asian culture, which led me to study abroad in Harbin, China. I chose Harbin because I wanted to be in a city with few Westerners and few English-speakers. That way, I would have no other choice but to learn the language, the culture, and gain a deep understanding of the people.  Before arriving in this foreign land, I had never thought about race or IQ, but I quickly started to notice differences. For example, Chinese people have an amazing ability for memorization. When people asked me for my cell phone number and I didn’t have a pen handy, I would just tell them it. They would repeat it once or twice aloud and be all set.  More than fifteen years later, and I am still in China, where I teach, translate, and advise Chinese businessmen and college students who are planning on going to the US. It has been that last role that turned me into a frank race realist, as almost every Chinese citizen I have met that’s interested in visiting or moving to the US is very interested and worried about the racial situation there. In having to explain the on-the-ground reality to people completely unfamiliar with America, Americans, and American culture, you have to be frank — and after that, you can’t put your head back in the sand.  For instance: All Americans know to avoid ghettos and majority black areas when traveling. It is just common sense. But China doesn’t have ghettos. There are cities that are more modern and developed than others, but public safety is generally the same regardless of where you are. The same can’t be said for America. If a white person walks around the streets in South Chicago at midnight, as opposed to North Chicago, the likelihood of being robbed or assaulted increases dramatically. While I never wanted to tell someone not to live in or pass through a black neighborhood, I couldn’t pretend to be ignorant of reality — and thereby endanger clients and friends — just to be politically correct.  Two incidents in particular come to mind when I was forced to either be blunt and honest or try to sugarcoat the truth. The first was when I met a Chinese businessman interested in buying a house in Detroit for a very low price. His daughter was going to school in America, and he was planning on immigrating. He wanted to buy a house that was incredibly cheap, fix it up while living there, then sell it. He planned to buy a house right in the heart of a ghetto. I warned him that it isn’t safe living and walking around in black neighborhoods. His reply was hopelessly naive: “I will be safe, lock my door and I won’t bother anyone. If I am friendly and don’t bother anyone, why would they bother me?”  The second was with a girl who was accepted to Temple University. She was very eager to go to America and live the American dream, and I was excited for her! I gave her a lot of information about Temple University and the city of Philadelphia. One important point I made to her was that Temple’s campus is very close to a ghetto. I told her, almost like a father would tell a daughter, “You will not go to this area!” She questioned my theory immediately, and asked incredulously, “Asian neighborhoods are fine, white neighborhoods are fine, but black neighborhoods should be avoided?” It was an awkward situation, but I felt that I had no choice but to be as honest as possible. I told her, “I think you will do very well in America. I have black friends, white friends, Asian friends, and Hispanic friends. I treat everyone the same. However, there is no denying the fact that crime in black areas is much, much higher than in white and Asian areas.”  After encountering several situations where I told the truth about America, I felt a sense of pride and professionalism in pulling no punches when describing the place. Unfortunately, I have many foreign friends in China who not only wouldn’t dare admit the reality about race and crime, but teach their students the exact opposite! Students love to hear foreign teachers debate this topic. They never imagined two foreigners from the same place could offer such contradicting views, or that this conflict of views could get so ugly. Despite having lived in China for the majority of my adult life, being married to a Chinese woman, and having mixed-race children, whites who cannot confront the reality about racial dynamics in America still tarnish me with the label “racist.”  Clashes between myself and liberal colleagues only intensified as time went on. In 2014, after Officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, some white teachers in China cited it as a perfect example of how whites in America “bully” and “oppress” blacks. This claim didn’t change even after the forensic evidence was released that did away with claims that Brown had had his hands up and was trying to flee. No matter what facts I pointed out to them, they all maintained that the whole incident was a clear cut example of a racist white cop “hunting” an innocent black male. The excuses white liberals give for black behavior in America go on to be taught to Chinese students with the same ignorant, nearly religious, certainty. Even in China one cannot escape the refrains about slavery, terror perpetrated by the KKK, Jim Crow, “lack of education,” “lack of resources,” “oppression,” etc.  Luckily, the Chinese do not seem to be as easily swayed as Americans. In 2016, a liberal Canadian and I were discussing immigration with our students. He asked them, “Wouldn’t you agree that the majority of foreigners who come to China are friendly, they teach you about Western culture, and should be welcomed here?” The students agreed, and the Canadian, pleased with himself, continued: “Then don’t you think it’s wrong for a person who wants to be President to not allow immigrants in? And wouldn’t it be heartless to build a wall to show the world that he doesn’t want them coming to America?” Once again, the students agreed.  I gave the class some more context to better understand the situation, and informed them that in 1960, whites were about 90 percent of the population in America. Today, their share of the total is closer to 60 percent — and in 25 years, they won’t even be the majority. I then asked them, “I’m sure we all agree that foreigners are welcome here?” Just as they had with the similar question from my colleague, the students agreed, but then I continued “What if someone suggested that we open the gates and flood China with millions upon millions of immigrants to the point where it would reduce the Han Chinese to a minority, would that be something you would approve of?” There was no ambiguity in their response: “China would never accept that.” Finally, I told them about the fences and security China has along its border with North Korea in Dandong (which I have seen in person), and asked, “Does anyone think that this border fence in Dandong is racist against foreigners?” Not one student said it was.  My lengthy stay in Asia has reshaped the way I think about race, crime, and immigration. China would never be intimidated into thinking they have to take in millions of refugees and unskilled immigrants. The Chinese people would never fall for the idea that they should reduce themselves to a minority in order to show how compassionate they are. It seems that all non-white countries respond in the same way. Nigerians don’t want to be reduced to a minority in their own county, neither do the Japanese or the Pakistanis. Perhaps my change in opinion about this reflects that my own thinking has become more “Chinese” after being here for so long.

We have heard 6 million lies about the “Holocaust”. The truth about the Holohoax has been hidden. Read below to uncover the cover-up!  Note: This blog series is derived from “Did Six Million Really Die?” book by Richard E. Harwood (1974) with many additional sources, originally presented in DJ Noble Protagonist’s E-book (The Battle to preserve Western Civilization): https://archive.org/details/@nobleprotagonist  Note: Core reference material: https://holocausthandbooks.com/   Also in German: http://holocausthandbuecher.com/   “NAZI DEATH CAMPS”  It is true that in 1945, Allied propaganda did claim that all the concentration camps, particularly those in Germany itself, were “Death Camps,” but not for long. On this question the American historian Professor Harry Elmer Barnes wrote, “These camps were first presented as those in Germany, such as Dachau, Belsen, Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen and Dora, but it was soon demonstrated that there had been no systematic extermination in those camps. Attention was then moved to Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec, Chelmno, Jonowska, Tarnow, Ravensbruck, Mauthausen, Brezeznia and Birkenau, which does not exhaust the list that appears to have been extended as needed.”  What had happened was that certain honest observers among the British & American occupation forces in Germany, while admitting that many camp inmates had died of disease & starvation in the final months of the war, had found no evidence after all of “gas chambers.”  As a result, eastern camps in the Russian zone of occupation, such as Auschwitz & Treblinka, gradually came to the fore as horrific centers of “extermination”, though no one was permitted to see them. This tendency has lasted almost to the present day.  Here in these camps it was all supposed to have happened, but with the Iron Curtain brought down firmly over them it was difficult to verify such charges. The Communists claimed that four million people died at Auschwitz in gigantic gas chambers accommodating 2,000 people, and no one could argue to the contrary.   THE LEUCHTER REPORT  In 1984 in Toronto, Canada, German-born publisher, Ernst Zundel, distributed his own edition of the pamphlet, “Did Six Million Really Die?”, and sent copies out to Canadian Members of Parliament; members of the clergy; journalists and broadcasters. A year later he was subsequently put on trial and sentenced to 15 months imprisonment followed by automatic deportation, after a Jewish complaint under an obscure law prohibiting the publication of “false news”.  This sentence was passed even though both the defense and the prosecution agreed that the bulk of “Did Six Million Really Die?” was correct and only small points were in dispute.  “The Leuchter Report” was actually commissioned by Ernst Zundel, to act in his defense, after his 1985 conviction was overturned by the Ontario Court of Appeal in 1987, and a retrial was ordered to commence in January, 1988.  In February 1988, the first forensic examination of the alleged execution gas chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau and Majdanek, was conducted by Fred Leuchter and subsequently published as “The Leuchter Report”.  Fred Leuchter, was an engineer who specializes in the design & fabrication of execution hardware used in prisons throughout the United States. One of his projects was the design of a new gas chamber at the Missouri State Penitentiary at Jefferson City.  In essence Fred Leuchter took samples from the walls of the alleged gas chambers and also from the walls of the de-lousing chambers so he could compare the claim that rather than Zyklon B being used to gas inmates of the various camps, it was actually used to de-louse the inmates clothing of lice in order to prevent outbreaks of typhus.  Leuchter’s results were overwhelming. He could find no trace of Zyklon B in the walls of the alleged gas chambers, yet it was overwhelmingly prevalent in the walls of the de-lousing chambers where the inmates’ clothing was cleaned of lice.  The Leuchter Report concludes, “After reviewing all the material and inspecting all of the sites at Auschwitz, Birkenau and Majdanek, your author finds the evidence overwhelming; there were no execution gas chambers at any of these locations. It is the best engineering opinion of this author that the alleged gas chambers at the inspected sites could not have been, or now, be utilized or seriously considered to function as execution gas chambers.”  Despite Fred Leuchter’s neutral position in questioning the official version of the “Holocaust” and his evidence based upon the exact science of forensic chemistry, Ernst Zundel was once again found guilty, albeit this time he was given a nine month sentence as opposed to the 15 month one he was given previously. He was granted bail after signing a “gag order”, promising not to write or speak about the “Holocaust”.  In 2003, Ernst Zundel was arrested at his quiet home in the mountain region of eastern Tennessee. U.S. authorities seized him on the pretext that he had violated immigration regulations, or had missed an interview date with US immigration authorities, even though he had entered the US legally, was married to an American citizen, had no criminal record, and was acting diligently, and in full accord with the law, to secure status as a permanent legal resident.  After being held for two weeks, he was deported to Canada. For two years he was held in solitary confinement in the Toronto West Detention Centre as a supposed threat to national security.  In 2005, Zundel was deported to Germany, just as Jewish groups had been demanding. Upon his arrival at Frankfurt airport, he was immediately arrested and taken to Mannheim prison to await trial for the “thought crime” of “denying the Holocaust.”  A few months later, the public prosecutor in Mannheim formally charged Zundel with inciting “hatred” by having written or distributed texts that “approve, deny or play down” genocidal actions carried out by Germany’s wartime regime, and which “denigrate the memory of the (Jewish) dead.” .  Zundel’s three-month trial concluded in 2007, when a court in Mannheim sentenced him to five years imprisonment for the crime of “popular incitement” under Germany’s notorious “Holocaust denial” statute. The court upheld efforts by German authorities to punish individuals for writings that are legal in the country (Canada) where they are published. Jewish groups quickly, and predictably, expressed approval of the verdict.  Zundel was released from prison in 2010. Banned from returning to either Canada or the United States, he went to his family home in Germany’s Black Forest region, where he resided until his death.  Meanwhile, Fred Leuchter was also “persecuted” & blacklisted by promoters of the Holohoax. In 1991, he was arrested & jailed in Germany for giving an anti-Holocaust lecture for Günther Deckert, a well-known political party leader. Leuchter was allowed out on bail. He returned to the U.S. and chose not to go back to Germany to stand trial. Nonetheless, he lost his livelihood as a result.  The Allied Committee of Inquiry has to date proven that no poison gas was ever used to kill prisoners in the following concentration camps… Bergen-Belsen, Buchenwald, Dachau, Flossenburg, Gross-Rosen, Mauthausen, and satellite camps.. Natzweller, Neuengamme, Niederhagen, Ravensbruck, Sachsenhausen, Stutthoff, Theresienstadt. In all cases where gassings were alleged, it could be proven that torture was used to extract confessions, and witnesses have lied. Any former inmate who, during their debriefing continues to allege that Poison gas was used to murder people, in particular Jews, are to be reported to this office, and if they insist on lying further, they are to be charged with perjury.” -Major Miller, Commanding Officer Allied Military Police Vienna  Note: In a 1985 court case, Dr. William Lindsey testified under oath that the Auschwitz gassing story is physically impossible. Based on his careful examination of the alleged gas chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau and Majdanek, and on his years of experience, he declared, “I have come to the conclusion that no one was willfully or purposefully killed with Zyklon B in this manner. I consider it absolutely impossible.”  Note: When American & British forces overran Western & Central Germany in the spring of 1945, they were followed by troops charged with discovering and securing any evidence of German war crimes. Among them was Dr. Charles Larson, one of America’s leading forensic pathologists, who was assigned to the US Army’s Judge Advocate General’s Department. As part of a US War Crimes Investigation Team, Dr. Larson performed autopsies at Dachau and some twenty other German camps, examining on some days more than 100 corpses. After his grim work at Dachau, he was questioned for three days by US Army prosecutors. In a 1980 newspaper interview Dr. Larson confirmed that there “never was a case of poison gas uncovered.”  FINAL FORENSIC NAIL IN THE COFFIN – AUSCHWITZ STORY  Germar Rudolf was born on October 29, 1964, in Limburg, Germany. He studied chemistry at Bonn University, where he graduated in 1989 as a Diplom-Chemist. From 1990-1993, he prepared a PhD thesis at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State research in conjunction with the University of Stuttgart. Parallel to this and in his spare time, Rudolf re-examined Auschwitz, Birkenau and other installations and buildings, testing brick and mortar samples of delousing chambers & alleged “gas chambers” for traces of Zyklon B.  Following the pioneering work of Fred Leuchter, Germar put the final forensic nail into the coffin of the Auschwitz story with his 1993 expert report, The Rudolf Report, which proved the “Holocaust” to be a Holohoax. Even though this book on Auschwitz was scientific in nature and utterly apolitical, Rudolf’s home & office were raided three times; his computers & papers seized.  In 1994 & 1995 he was charged and tried in Germany for his expert report. As a scientist, he found the “gassing” claims to be scientifically untenable. Rudolf was found guilty and convicted to 14 month imprisonment. As a result, the University of Stuttgart denied him to pass his final PhD exam.  Rudolf tried to avoid serving this prison term by going into British exile with his young wife and two babies. There he started a small revisionist outlet for German language material, Castle Hill Publishers, and VHO.org, a multilingual website, which within a few years outgrew other revisionist websites by size & traffic. In early 1999, due to the permanent persecutorial pressure, his wife filed for divorce and returned to Germany with their two babies.  When Germany wanted to have Rudolf extradited from Britain in 1999, he fled to the United States, where he applied for political asylum. While his case wound its way through the U.S. legal system, Rudolf expanded his publishing activities into English language material, for instance by launching the ambitious “Holocaust Handbook Series” [linked at the top of this article].  In 2004 Rudolf married again, this time a U.S. citizen, and soon became the father of a young baby daughter. Immediately after this marriage was recognized as genuine by the U.S. Immigration Services in October 2005, and at a time when a hearing of his asylum case was just being scheduled by a U.S. Federal Court, the U.S. government had Rudolf arrested and deported to Germany.  Hence, his asylum hearing which took place in absentia a few months later was nothing but a farce. In Germany, Rudolf was duly arrested and put on trial again for his revisionist publishing activities abroad. Although Rudolf’s activities had been perfectly legal both in the United Kingdom and the United States, Germany nevertheless applied German censorship laws and sentenced Rudolf to another 30 months imprisonment.  On July 5, 2009, Rudolf was released from prison. After a legal battle against the U.S. government lasting almost two years, Rudolf finally succeeded in obtaining an immigrant visa for the U.S. He has been reunited with his wife & daughter since August, 2011.  Note: In 1995, one of France’s most influential & respected magazines, L’Express, acknowledged that “everything is false” about the Auschwitz “gas chamber” that for decades has been shown to tens of thousands of tourists yearly.  Note: On page 541 of (Jewish historian) Olga Wormser-Migot’s thesis on the system of National Socialists concentration camps, there is a passage on the “gas chambers”. There, the reader will find three additional surprises. According to Olga, the “problem” lies in attempting to determine whether the “gas chambers” at Ravensbrück (Germany) & Mauthausen (Austria) ever existed; she concludes that they didn’t.  GAS CHAMBERS WERE NOT CREMATORIES  Stephen F. Pinter, who served as a lawyer for the United States War Department in the occupation forces in Germany & Austria for six years after the war, made an astonishing statement in the widely read Catholic magazine, “Our Sunday Visitor”, on June 14, 1959.  Pinter admitted, “I was in Dachau for 17 months after the war, as a U.S. War Department Attorney, and can state that there was no gas chamber at Dachau. What was shown to visitors & sightseers there and erroneously described as a ‘gas chamber’ was a crematory. Nor was there a gas chamber in any of the other concentration camps in Germany. We were told that there was a gas chamber at Auschwitz, but since that was in the Russian zone of occupation, we were not permitted to investigate since the Russians would not allow it. From what I was able to determine during six postwar years in Germany & Austria, there were a number of Jews killed, but the figure of a million was certainly never reached. I interviewed thousands of Jews, former inmates of concentration camps in Germany and Austria and consider myself as well qualified as any man on this subject.”  Pinter tells a very different story from the customary propaganda. He is very astute on the question of the crematory being represented as a chamber. This is a frequent ploy because no such thing as a “gas chamber” has ever been shown to exist in these camps, hence the deliberately misleading term “gas oven”, aimed at confusing a gas chamber with a crematorium. The latter, usually single furnace and similar to the kind of thing employed today, were used quite simply for the cremation of those persons who had died from various natural causes within the camp, particularly infectious diseases.  This fact was conclusively proved by the German arch bishop Faulhaber of Munich. He informed the Americans that during the Allied air raid on Munich, in September 1944, 30,000 people were killed. The archbishop requested the authorities at the time to cremate the bodies, but was told that, unfortunately, this plan could not be carried out; the crematorium, having only one furnace, was not able to cope with the many bodies of the air raid victims.  Clearly, therefore, the crematorium could not have coped with the 238,000 Jewish bodies which were allegedly cremated there. In order to do so, the crematorium would have to be kept going for 326 years without stopping and 530 tons of ashes would have been recovered.  The figures of Dachau casualties are typical of the kind of exaggerations that have since been drastically revised. In 1946, a memorial plaque was unveiled at Dachau by Philip Auerbach, the Jewish State-Secretary in the Bavarian Government who was convicted for embezzling money, which he claimed as compensation for non-existent Jews. The plaque read, “This area is being retained as a shrine to the 238,000 individuals who were cremated here.”  Since then, the official casualty figures of Dachau have had to be steadily revised downwards, and now stand at only 20,600; the majority, from typhus & starvation only at the end of the war.  Note: Dachau was one the first concentration camp set up soon after the National Socialists came to power. These first camps were in reality large prisons to which inmates had been sentenced by the ordinary criminal courts to fixed terms of imprisonment. Membership in the Communist Party was a frequent criminal offense. Jews were largely involved in communist activities, and were imprisoned accordingly.

Hernández's hospitalization Wednesday comes as the Central American country struggles to contain the sudden rise of the pandemic's strain in the capital.  President Hernández announced late Tuesday that he and his wife had tested positive for the ravaging virus. Just hours later he was hospitalized after doctors determined he had pneumonia.  On Wednesday, Francis Contreras, spokesman for the National System of Risk Management, said at a news conference that after reviewing Hernández's lab work and X-rays, doctors determined the president had pneumonia and recommended he be hospitalized.  He said Hernández was in good condition, but he was receiving medicine intravenously that had to be administered in the Military Hospital.  Honduras confirmed 6,327 coronavirus infections from March to June 7. In the 10 days since, health officials have reported an additional 3,972 confirmed cases - a surge that has come after the government began a gradual reactivation of the economy.  Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernández (left) and his wife Ana Garcia (right) tested positive for the coronavirus Tuesday. Hernández was hospitalized Wednesday after doctor's diagnosed him with pneumonia  Juan Orlando Hernández, the president of Honduras, is in good condition after receiving medicine intravenously after doctor diagnosed him with pneumonia. Hernández and his wife tested positive for COVID-19  The northern business hub of San Pedro Sula still accounts for the majority of the cases, but the capital, Tegucigalpa, is the focus of new infections.  Health Minister Alba Consuelo Flores confirmed that hospitals in those cities are nearly full, but said the government had to begin loosening restrictions.  Many businesses closed since March have been allowed to reopen, though with reduced capacity. Those companies provide passes to their workers allowing them to avoid a national curfew that has been extended to June 28 and only allows people to leave home for essentials on certain days based on their national ID number.  'If we don't activate the economy we're going to have another kind of pandemic that is hunger, malnutrition and probably social crises,' Flores said.  She said if the people continue to be disciplined they will be able to manage the epidemic. The country made wearing masks obligatory and businesses are reopening with just 20% of their personnel.  But Suyapa Figueroa, president the Honduras Medical College, said hospitals are already being overwhelmed.  The School Hospital, the capital's largest public hospital, has already outfitted additional rooms for COVID-19 patients, but they haven't kept up with the demand, she said. Several dozen people were awaiting space to be hospitalized, she said.  Asked for comment, the hospital sent a WhatsApp message suggesting two of its officials to speak with late Wednesday but neither could be reached.  A local news station circulated video Tuesday of more than a dozen bodies wrapped in black bags scattered through hallways and rooms in the hospital's overwhelmed morgue.  Figueroa said that due to a shortage of pressure gauges, oxygen is shifted from patient to patient in turns.  Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernández (left) revealed late Tuesday night that he and the first lady, Ana Garcia (left), contracted COVID-19.  The School Hospital is one health center where the International Committee of the Red Cross is supporting the country's health system.  The organization has established a dual triage system that allows it to isolate those arriving with COVID-19 symptoms and try to refer them to other hospitals where there is bed space, said Karim Khallaayoun, mission chief for the Red Cross in Honduras. The group has also supplied personal protective equipment for hospital staff, training on how to use it and counseling as the physical and psychological strain of the work takes its toll.  'Over the past week, we are seeing an exponential increase in Tegucigalpa,' Khallaayoun said. 'Tegucigalpa has now become the epicenter of the contagion in the country.'  He said most intensive care beds in the capital are full and the caseload is expected to continue growing in coming days.  Noting that the disease has been unpredictable, Khallaayoun said, 'it's quite possible that the hospital system is going to be overwhelmed in the next two, three weeks before we see a descent in the figures.'  Honduras has had nearly 10,000 confirmed cases of the disease and 330 deaths. But testing is limited and the real figures are surely much higher. The Health Ministry began sending teams into neighborhoods Tuesday to perform rapid tests for the coronavirus in an effort to detect infections before hospitalization is required.  Last week, the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders said it had started treating critical COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen in a 20-bed ward set up at the National Autonomous University of Honduras. The goal was to relieve pressure on the public health system.  President Hernández had said that over the weekend he began feeling some discomfort and on Tuesday received the test results.  He said it was part of the risk that comes with the job. With his responsibilities, he said, he could not stay at home constantly.  Hernández said he had started what he called the 'MAIZ treatment,' an experimental combination of microdacyn, azithromycin, ivermectin and zinc.  He said his wife was asymptomatic and two other people who work with them are also infected.  Hernández is a close ally of the Trump administration, primarily in efforts to slow illegal immigration. However, U.S. federal prosecutors in New York have prosecuted the president's brother and made it increasingly clear that a case is building against Hernández himself.  No charges have been filed against the president, but U.S. prosecutors have alleged he accepted money from drug traffickers to advance his political career in exchange for letting them move drugs through the country. Hernández denies those allegations.  He was re-elected in a disputed November 2017 election, despite the country's constitutional ban on reelection.

Thau, head of the Swing Voter Project for the polling consultancy firm Engagious, told CNN on Wednesday:  Focus groups are early-detection systems of shifting public opinion. Before something important appears in polling it often bubbles up first in focus group conversations.  And, each month for the past 17 months, I’ve had a unique window into the Americans largely responsible for giving the president his slim Electoral College victory: [the] so-called “Obama-Trump” swing voters across the upper Midwest.  Our Swing Voter Project has uncovered that many of these people … prefer Trump over Biden. In fact, 22 of 33 respondents [in Ohio, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Michigan] feel this way.   Thau explained why:  • They think a businessman is best suited to turn the country around;  • They feel that COVID-19 was not Trump’s fault;  • They equate the Black Lives Matter protestors with the rioters attacking federal buildings and retail businesses;  • They don’t want historic monuments torn down;  • They dismiss the idea of defunding the police as “ridiculous”;  • They want America to be first;  • They oppose immigration policies that grant benefits to foreigners at their expense; and  • They like a leader who fights back instead of a politician who “folds in the face of special interests.”  From his focus group conversations with these voters, Thau learned that most of them “couldn’t name a single thing [that] Biden had said or done regarding the pandemic. In bellwether Macomb County [Michigan], on July 21, none of the nine voters I interviewed could name a single thing Biden had achieved in nearly 50 years in national politics.”  And several told him they perceived Biden as a “puppet” of special interests if he were elected, while others said they were convinced that Biden has dementia, even mocking him after viewing videos of his gaffes online.  He noted the difference in their views of Biden compared to Hillary Clinton:  These swing voters do not dislike Biden the way they still dislike Hillary Clinton.  And, so, Trump is taking a different approach, casting doubt on Biden by focusing on questions of his mental acuity and verbal mistakes … [and for] not having yielded a single, career-defining achievement….  Come Election Day, these swing voters’ decisions will hinge on whether they’re better off than they were four years ago. For now, most have told me they are.  If Thau is right — that these focus groups constitute a sort of “early-detection systems” whose positions often “bubble up” before the national polling discovers it — is there evidence to show it?  From Change Research, self-described as a left-leaning polling firm in San Francisco that was co-founded in 2017 by a former Democratic Party campaign activist, comes possible proof of the shift from Biden to Trump in six key “battleground” states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.  Two weeks ago, Change Research joined with CNBC to quiz voters in those states. In all six of them Biden led Trump by anywhere between one and eight percentage points. One week later Biden’s lead had shrunk significantly, to just two or three points, within the polls’ margins of error.  As Change Research no doubt reluctantly admitted: “The battleground ballot has tightened … [with Trump’s] approval up two points [in the past week].”  Other pollsters such as Cardinal Point Analytics (CPA) — a North Carolina pollster based in Raleigh that claims it accurately predicted “every major political race in North Carolina including President Trump’s election and Governor McCrory’s defeat” — show an even tighter race. In North Carolina, CPA shows Trump ahead of Biden by two points.  With the vast majority of most voters firmly locked into supporting either Biden or Trump, it will be these “swing voters’ who will likely determine the outcome in November.

The drugs, estimated to be worth $1 million, were discovered under the floor compartment of a 21-year-old U.S. citizen’s sedan Wednesday morning when he was attempting to enter the United States.  When he attempted to enter the U.S. through the checkpoint, CBP officers requested that the vehicle receive an additional inspection. During the more thorough secondary inspection of the sedan, officers discovered 68 drug packages under the floor compartment. Of the drugs seized, 102 pounds were heroin and 1.5 pounds were fentanyl, the CBP determined.  “Federal law allows officers to charge individuals by complaint, a method that allows the filing of charges for criminal activity without inferring guilt,” the press release clarifies. It adds that: “An individual is presumed innocent unless and until competent evidence is presented to a jury that establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.”  After the inspection, the officers seized the narcotics and sedan, arrested the man, and then gave him to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations.

The opioid epidemic is responsible for taking thousands of American lives each year and potent synthetic opioid drugs like fentanyl can cause overdoses in small amounts. Sara A.

While we were there, President Donald Trump, in a blink of a tweet, rescinded DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.  A member of our volunteer team was a DACA recipient, and he decided to drive back to Stanford alone. But with DACA protections now up in the air, there was no way I would let him risk a multi-state trip by himself. So, I jumped in the car and together we hit the road. I feared his work permit had protections only as strong as the paper it was printed on.  I know border patrol checkpoints. I grew up on the Southern California border, surrounded by checkpoints to the north and west. I was in kindergarten during the peak Proposition 187 years and am one of the 16.7 million Americans with a mixed-status family. While Prop. 187 was never fully enacted, it whipped up a fervor of anti-immigrant activity, similar to Arizona under SB 1070, that cut just as deep.  On our journey through Texas, we were stopped twice at checkpoints. I’ve been through checkpoints hundreds of times. But this time, sweat pooled down my neck and my stomach spiraled. One stop was particularly scary.  My friend was ordered out of the car. With his permit in hand, the agent said, “This doesn’t work anymore.”  “We’re just trying to get back to Stanford!” I yelled from the driver’s seat. Performative academia and the Stanford bumper sticker helped a lot in that moment. “We’re grad students!”  He asked to see our student identification. I think he thought we were lying. He came up to the driver’s side. “This doesn’t work anymore, got it?” he said of the permit.  We peeled off, not stopping again until the gas tank was about to hit empty.  It was maddening to feel so helpless.  Waiting for the U.S. Supreme Court to decide this month on the termination of DACA feels the same way. There are so many unknowns. We cannot ever fully understand the depth of anguish and complexity of feelings our DACA-mented friends feel as they manage life in one-year intervals. But, regardless of outcome, we should take solace in knowing we’ve been down this road before.  The lessons of Prop. 187 remind us that the future of the immigrants’ rights movement is in our hands. In 1994, 10,000 students walked out of classes, 70,000 people flooded downtown Los Angeles and a generation of leaders emerged from a blatantly racist attack on the Latinx community. The lessons from Prop. 187 ring clear: the actions we take now to demand dignity will outlive this moment, no matter how bleak.  Because of those walkouts, my peers and I grew up in a California drastically different from what Prop. 187 envisioned. We cannot ignore the line from immigrants’ rights activism in the ’90s to the direct actions in the 2010s. Some led quiet, but critical acts of allyship: driving friends to college campuses, telling their stories at college forums, holding elected officials to account and organizing on campuses and communities.

Some changed the course of history. The solemn march of four immigrant youth from Miami, Fla., to Washington, D.C., on the “trail of dreams” sparked the term “Dreamer.” Patricia Okoumou shocked the world by climbing the Statue of Liberty on the Fourth of July to protest the detention of migrant children.  Prop. 187 emboldened a generation. Those who fought for DACA organized a future into existence. And today’s immigrants’ rights movement is primed to learn from Black Lives Matters’ steadfast commitment to long-term movement planning. Now it’s our turn.  When we finally made it out of Texas, the road ahead broke into cotton-candy pink skies. Zipping past the desert sky felt like freedom. Like this moment, we did not know what obstacles lie ahead, but we knew the journey. Like those who marched against Prop. 187, fighting for the next generation they did not know and could not see, we too must continue the journey. There are pink skies and a better future ahead.

Like many other tech companies, it will be going public without ever turning a profit.  In filings with the Security and Exchange Commission Tuesday, Palantir presented a first public look at its financials — which included $580 million in losses last year — and its heavy reliance on government contracts.  It also indicated it is on track to exceed $1 billion in annual revenues. It cited revenues of $481 million for the first half of 2020, up 49% from the year-ago period.  Its 2019 revenues of $746 million were up 25% from the previous year, the company said.  The growth included a big boost from the U.S. Army, from which it has earned $135 million since a favourable September 2018 court ruling forced the Pentagon to consider commercially available products in building its systems. That ruling opened a big door to Palantir.  The document indicated that Denver-based Palantir will sell stock some time this year but did not specify a date. A company spokeswoman declined comment on the filing.  Founded in 2003 by investors including Peter Thiel, the PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, Palantir got involved early on in government counterintelligence work with seed money from In-Q-Tel, the investment arm of the Central Intelligence Agency.  Tuesday’s filing mentions the company’s work helping U.S. soldiers counter an epidemic of roadside bombings and assisting Special Forces in the fight against ISIS.  Palantir said it had 125 customers in 150 countries including Airbus, Merck, Credit Suisse and the Danish National Police. Just shy of half its revenues were from government agencies last year, the company said.  Palantir is reported to have raised at least $2.5 billion in funding to date.  The company’s first product, Gotham, was built for defence and intelligence analysts and has also been used by U.S. police agencies. It identifies patterns deep within datasets. Its other platform, Foundry, is designed to link various complicated and diverse systems into a central operating system.  In the filing, Palantir said it believes current instability including “systematic failures of government institutions to provide for the public” present a growth opportunity for its business. One of its current contracts with the Department of Health and Human Services helps organize diverse data streams to help make sense of the COVID-19 response. It has a similar contract with Britain’s National Health Service.  On the downside, the company said a limited number of customers account for a significant amount of its revenue. Three customers make up just shy of a third of that revenue, Palantir said, without naming them. The 2,398-employee company also cited as a risk factor its high dependence on CEO and co-founder Alex Karp, who it said was paid $12 million last year.  Also capable of hurting business is “unfavourable coverage in the media,” Palantir acknowledged, from social activism. Last year, that included the picketing of Karp’s home over a company contract to upgrade software used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Campaigns on college campuses also hurt company recruitment.  Palantir initially filed for the stock sale confidentially on July 6. It said in the documents made public on Tuesday that it had $200 million in outstanding debt as of July 31.  Under the stock listing, the documents say, control of Palantir will be concentrated with the company’s founders through the designation of a new category of stock. It says Thiel controls 30% of Palantir’s voting power, with Karp having 9%  Frank Bajak, The Associated Press  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 11, "positive": 16, "negative": 6, "disgust": 1, "joy": 2, "anger": 8, "surprise": 2, "fear": 11, "trust": 4}, "metadata": ["boston", "document", "spokeswoman", "declined", "peter", "funding", "naming", "ceo", "alex", "immigration", "customs", "trump", "hurt", "initially", "designation", "thiel"]}, {"text": "Lessons that must be learned.  The world has been sent reeling by the Coronavirus pandemic that has yet to run its course.  However, even though this deadly pandemic is still ongoing, it is not too soon to take stock of a number of critical issues. In point of fact, it is probably best to begin this process before the pandemic ends and the public permits this global crisis to fade from their minds as it fades from the news reports.  To begin with, as I noted in my previous article, Because of the Coronavirus, Borders Suddenly Matter. For all of the bogus slanderous claims hurled by the radical Left in the media and politics, securing borders against those infected with a dangerous virus is not a matter of racism and xenophobia – but survival.  Unlike most politicians, President Trump has the chutzpah to call things as he sees them. This, by itself, is enough to traumatize the Left. Trump has come to refer to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) by the term “China Virus,” sending many “journalists” into paroxysms of rage and disgust, claiming that referring to this virus that, in point of fact, originated in China, demonstrates that Trump is a racist.  Time for a reality check.  Various illnesses have traditionally been named for the locations where the diseases originated. The devastating Spanish Flu of 1918 was so-named because, it originated in Spain.  In 1972, at the beginning of my career with the former INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service), I became infected with a very serious illness that was referred to as the London Flu. I was an Immigration Inspector at JFK International Airport at the time and consequently was exposed to a variety of pathogens brought to the United States by foreign visitors. I wound up in the hospital and nearly died, my fever maxed at more than 105 degrees. Some of my colleagues were similarly sickened by this particularly virulent illness.  The doctors and nurses who treated me all referred to my illness as the London Flu. I doubt that they disliked Brits or Londoners.  Clearly the mainstream media and the radical Left despise the President and on a nearly daily basis demonstrate an irrational response to virtually everything he does and says.  But could it be that their extreme abhorrence of the term “China Virus” has a more deep-seated origin? Perhaps it goes back to how they were educated in American colleges.  When misleading terms are used, such as the term “immigrant” instead of “alien” most write this off as being Politically Correct. In reality this is nothing short of Orwellian Newspeak and it must always be described as such.  Today. as we will see, many of Ameria’s premier universities are under the influence of the Chinese government and other governments that are hostile to the United States.  Chinese Aggression Against the U.S.A. manifests itself in many ways, especially through widespread espionage.  The Communist, totalitarian Chinese regime is extremely sensitive to the way that they are perceived around the world. They have infiltrated many universities around the United States for a number of significant purposes that include having their scientists, engineers, computer programmers and other STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) professionals trained in the United States, and maintaining strict control over those students when they are in the United States.  Many Chinese students are coerced in spying on the United States when they secure “Optional Practical Training” by working for American companies.  It has been recently alleged by the U.S. Department of Education that China and other countries have been allegedly pouring billions of dollars into American Universities that went unreported by those universities, in violation of U.S. laws.  On February 12, 2020 the Department of Education (DOE) issued a press release: U.S. Department of Education Launches Investigation into Foreign Gifts Reporting at Ivy League Universities that included this subtitle:  Since July, the Department has uncovered more than $6 billion in unreported foreign gifts from countries including Qatar, China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.  The DOE press release also included these excerpts:  The Department is also concerned Harvard University may lack appropriate institutional controls over foreign money and has failed to report fully all foreign gifts and contracts as required by law. This comes after Dr. Charles Lieber, chair of Harvard University’s Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department, was indicted for lying about his involvement with the Chinese government’s Thousand Talents Plan and admitting that Harvard lacks adequate institutional controls for effective oversight and tracking of very large donations. [ … ] The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations described foreign spending on U.S. schools as “a black hole” because colleges and universities “routinely” fail to comply with the law, and reported foreign money can come with strings attached that might compromise academic freedom. [ … ] Additional Information on the Department’s Section 117 Enforcement Actions: Since July 1, 2019, the Department’s enforcement efforts have triggered the reporting of approximately $6.5 billion in previously undisclosed foreign money.  Ten schools, including Cornell University, Yale University, the University of Colorado Boulder, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Chicago, the University of Pennsylvania, Boston University, Texas A&M University, and Carnegie Mellon University reported approximately $3.6 billion in previously unreported foreign gifts.  The Department has opened eight civil compliance investigations since June 28, 2019.  The Department has reported its preliminary findings to Congress including:  The largest colleges and universities are multi-billion dollar, multi-national enterprises using opaque foundations, foreign campuses, and other sophisticated legal structures to generate revenue that is intermingled with domestic sources of funding from tuition, grants, and the like.  These colleges and universities actively solicit foreign governments, corporations, and nationals for funds although some donors are known to be hostile to the United States and may be seeking to project “soft power,” steal sensitive and proprietary research and development data and other intellectual property, and spread propaganda benefitting foreign governments.  At the beginning of the onslaught of the Coronavirus, President Trump quickly decided to bar the entry of nonimmigrant aliens from China to prevent the spread of the virus into the United States, invoking 8 U.S. Code § 1182(f), a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) that he previously used to prevent the entry of aliens from countries associated with international terrorism and where our officials were unable to effectively vet those who sought entry into the United States.  As the disease spread through Europe, especially Italy, the President expanded the list of countries whose nonimmigrant citizens would be barred from entering the United States to try to slow the spread of the disease.  The Democrats, led by Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and the other “usual suspects,” attacked the President for being a racist and xenophobe. They should have used a different term, “Leader!”  Now many other countries around the world have taken similar measures. Dr. Anthony Fauci lauded Trump’s important decision stating that this single act, of closing our nation’s borders, has been one of the most effective measures take by Trump to help save lives in America.  For decades China has run roughshod over America.  Out of extreme corporate greed, the production of our essential pharmaceuticals has been shipped to China and other countries that do not have our best interests at heart, leaving America vulnerable. China has now threatened to stop the flow of vital antibiotics to the United States and has actually accused the U.S. Army of planting the Coronavirus in China!  President Trump is the first president, in decades, to stand up to this Communist dictatorship that openly boasts it plans to dominate the world. Trump’s actions have undoubtedly done much more than just ruffle some feathers in Beijing.  President Trump has gone on the offensive in his strategies to protect America and Americans.  Our nation has been rendered vulnerable to one of America’s most dangerous adversaries by corporations that seek cheap labor and no regulations and have moved production of vital supplies to China and other countries. To be able to do this, the corporations have pumped huge amounts of cash into the campaign coffers of politicians who need the money to win their elections. Not unlike prostitutes they will apparently do whatever it takes to satisfy their donors.  As I noted, in part, in a speech I gave in Washington several years ago:  The practitioners of the two oldest professions will assume any position, no matter how dangerous, ridiculous, uncomfortable or contrary to commonsense – for the right price!  The time has come to finally clean out the bordellos!  EDITORS NOTE: This FrontPage Magazine column is republished with permission. © All rights reserved.

Racism argues that humans can be divided into different racial groups, each with characteristics that are inherited and unchanging — and that those differences explain inequality in societies.  Racism is an ideology that holds that humans can be divided into different racial groups, each with characteristics that are inherited and unchanging. Racism argues that those differences explain inequality in societies.   Early Racism  While xenophobia — or fear of those unlike ourselves — has long been a part of human cultures, the concept of race first appeared in the English language around the 17th century. North Americans began to use the term in their scientific writings by the late 18th century. Racism began to be studied by scientists in the 19th century. At the time the ideology explained some political and economic conflicts in parts of the world, and legitimized the dominant role of British capitalism in the world economic system.  Racism is universal. It is evident in many different ethno-racial groups and is not limited to Caucasian groups.  By the mid-19th century, many racists believed the world’s population could be divided into a variety of races: groups of people who shared similar physical attributes, such as skin colour and hair texture. This process of race categorization is referred to as racialization and is necessary for the emergence of racism as an ideology.   Core Beliefs  Racism claims the human species can be divided into discrete biological groupings that determine the behaviour, economic, and political success of individuals within that group. This belief views races as natural and fixed subdivisions of the human species, each with its distinct and variable cultural characteristics and capacity for the development of civilizations. Thus, racists believe that biological factors can be used to explain the social and cultural variations of humans. Racism also includes the belief that there is a natural hierarchical ordering of groups of people so that superior races can dominate inferior ones. It is not a study of race, or of the present inequality of certain groups in society, but it is an assertion that inequality is absolute and unconditional.  Racist thinking presumes that differences among groups are innate and not subject to change. Thus, intelligence, attitudes and beliefs are viewed as not affected by one’s environment or history. The existence of groups at the bottom or top of the social hierarchy is interpreted as the natural outcome of an inferior or superior biological makeup and not the result of social influences. Racists reject social integration because they believe the mixing of groups would result in the degeneration of the superior group.  If biological differences are not easily discernible, racists invent biological differences (for example — size of nose or colour of eyes). Racism does not exist because of the presence of objective, physical differences among humans, but rather the social recognition of and the importance attached to such differences.  Racist ideology is based upon three false assumptions: That biological differences are equal to cultural differences; that biological makeup determines the cultural achievements of a group; and that biological makeup limits the type of culture a group can develop. Research shows these assumptions are wrong and largely based on the untenable position that nature (biology) is a single causal agent. Evidence showing that differences within groups are greater than differences between groups, and that social factors have an impact on behaviour, argue strongly against racist beliefs.   Changing Racist Discourse  Racist ideology was taken to extremes in Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. After the Second World War, the concept of race became seen increasingly as an inappropriate biological description, and an integral part of a host of discredited political platforms, including eugenics.  Research today tends to focus on the genetic underpinning of human variance, such as in the Human Genome Project. One of the most significant findings of the Project is that humans are far more alike than they are different — 99.9 per cent of genetic material is the same for all humans.  Scientists today tend to refer to continental ancestry over race, as this is a more exact description of what genetics reveals.   Institutional Racism  In the 1960s, the concept of racism was usually applied to the treatment of individuals and the belief that one individual was racially inferior. The term has since broadened to include institutional racism — describing political, economic and social institutions that operate to the detriment of a specific individual or group. Cultural racism is based on the supposed incompatibility of cultural traditions rather than ideas of innate biological superiority.  Racism can also be reflected in the ways that social institutions operate, by denying groups of people fair and equitable treatment. In this case we talk about structure and power, otherwise known as institutional racism. This includes the power to establish what is normal, necessary and desirable and reinforces superiority or preferences for one group over another.  The Chinese head tax is an example of institutional racism. It stemmed from the belief that Chinese immigrants would be a burden on the then-predominantly White Canadian society.  Institutional racism also exists when policies or programs seem racially neutral, but either intentionally or unintentionally put minority group members at a disadvantage. As an example, in certain provinces the process for selecting citizens for jury duty results in Aboriginal people rarely being selected. These dimensions of racism reveal that power, and individuals in positions of power, can create or perpetuate racial policies or practises.   Contemporary Attitudes  In the latter half of 20th century, some North American scholars continued to argue there were racial differences at the root of social behaviours. Arthur Jensen, a professor of education at University of California Berkeley, claimed there were measurable intelligence differences between Blacks and Whites. R. Herrnstein and C. Murray supported Jensen's work and argued that general intelligence varied according to race. They claimed to have detected a pattern showing differences between Asians, Whites and Blacks. In Canada, Jean Phillipe Rushton claimed to detect a clear social and psychological ranking among Asians, Whites and Blacks, in that order, for some characteristics including sexual behaviour and intelligence. These claims have not been supported by other researchers and the results are not considered scientific.  Examples of individual and institutional racism in Canada's history are evident in its restrictive immigration policies, and in practices regarding Aboriginal people and non-White immigrants, particularly Asians, Blacks and Jews. Some of the most intense racist policies have been directed at Aboriginal people. Until 1960, Aboriginal adults could not vote in federal elections unless they first renounced their Indian Act status and gave up treaty rights.  In 1880, the Canadian government began sponsoring religious schools designed to assimilate Aboriginal children into Euro-Canadian culture. From the 1930s to the 1990s, institutions across the country were dedicated to assimilating Aboriginal children into the dominant culture. Many children were taken from their parents and subjected to humiliating abuse, scientific experiments and poor living conditions. Aboriginal culture was routinely insulted, and many students were beaten if they spoke their own language.  Aboriginal students attending the Metlakatla Indian Residential School.

(Credit: William James Topley / Library and Archives Canada / C-015037) PreviousNext  Aboriginal women are murdered or go missing in Canada at much higher rates than non-Aboriginal women — a fact that many believe stems from the impact of racism. Aboriginal women account for only 4.3 per cent of Canadian women, but 16 per cent of all homicide victims.  Black Canadians have faced higher scrutiny from police and reports show evidence of racial profiling. One study found that police described 33.6 per cent of drivers stopped in Toronto by police as Black, compared to about 8.1 per cent of the total population being Black.   Fighting Racism  Over the past quarter-century, the provincial and federal governments have implemented laws to combat racism. In some cases the government has taken individuals — for example, Jim Keegstra and Ernst Zundel — to court under hate propaganda laws, in an attempt to stop them from spreading their racist beliefs. While blatant racist ideology is uncommon (see Ku Klux Klan) examples of racist beliefs are still evident. Today, racism and discrimination is more commonly experienced by visible minorities — even though Statistics Canada predicts that by 2017, more than 20 per cent of the population will be a visible minority.  Canada has federal and provincial laws to protect individuals, groups, and cultural expressions. However, forms of racism and discrimination persist. The Canadian Human Rights Act makes it discriminatory to communicate hatred. The Act protects Canadians from public statements that promote hatred, or incite hate against an identifiable group based on their ethnicity and/or skin colour.  The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms specifically addresses the constitutional rights that are necessary in a democratic society, and all Canadian law must be consistent with the Charter. The equality of all Canadians is protected under the Charter. The Charter also protects certain rights guaranteed to Aboriginal peoples, and it affirms Canada's multicultural heritage.  Copy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (courtesy Dept of Secretary of State, Canada). Copy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (courtesy Dept of Secretary of State, Canada). PreviousNext  The Canadian Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on individual characteristics including race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation or marital status. The Canadian Multiculturalism Act protects groups from cultural discrimination and is a commitment to new Canadians that they may retain aspects of their culture in Canada. Other key pieces of legislation include the Criminal Code of Canada (which prohibits the promotion of hatred and hate propaganda), and the Employment Equity Act, which protects against discriminatory hiring practices that disadvantage women, Aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities and members of visible minorities.

For only the second time as president, Trump addressed the nation in a formal Oval Office speech on March 11. The U.S., he told Americans, would expeditiously defeat this virus. (Doug Mills/The New York Times via AP, Pool, File)  WASHINGTON – His face framed by the golden Oval Office curtains behind him, President Donald Trump stared straight into the camera aimed at the Resolute Desk.  It was the night of March 11, 2020. And Trump’s presidency would be forever changed.  Trump, whose improbable election ripped up the rules of American politics, had spent three-plus years defying history and orthodoxy in a chaotic spectacle that dominated the national discourse and fervently engaged both sides of a bitterly divided country. And now, essentially for the first time, he was confronted by a crisis that was not of his own making.  It was the kind of test presidents inevitably must face, and Trump responded with trademark certitude.  “The virus will not have a chance against us,” Trump told Americans that night.  Five months later, the coronavirus has killed more than 175,000 Americans and left tens of millions unemployed. And now, as Trump prepares to again accept the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday in a ceremony at the White House, he must convince an electorate that has largely disapproved of his handling of the pandemic that he is not to blame, deserves another term and that all the chaos has been worth it.  “The future of our country and indeed our civilization is at stake on Nov. 3,” Trump said Friday.  Trump has spent his presidency bending Washington to his will. He has transformed a public health crisis into a political litmus test. He has presided over a booming, if stratified, economy, and claimed he created it. He has again forced race to the center of the American conversation, using federal police to enforce his view. He has alienated historical allies and changed how much of the world views the United States.  At seminal moments — in set speeches, impromptu riffs and long-sought policy reversals, examined in this story — he has redefined, at least temporarily, the presidency.  But he has not shaken the virus.   ___   THE ADDRESS  A virus born in China had swept through Europe and reached America’s shores. Global markets were tumbling, hospitals filling, cities locking down. On the day the coronavirus was officially declared a pandemic, beloved actor Tom Hanks announced he had tested positive. The NBA suspended its season.  And for only the second time as president, Trump addressed the nation in a formal Oval Office speech. He spoke slowly, his voice halting, and he seemed unsure of what to do with his hands.  The U.S., he told Americans, would “expeditiously defeat this virus.” But by any measure, Trump’s address didn’t go over well: The White House had to correct significant errors — one on travel from Europe, another on international cargo — within minutes of the speech’s conclusion.  And ever since, the virus has proven impervious to bullying tweets or the ability to dictate cable news chyrons. It has upended American politics, stripping Trump of both his most potent reelection argument, a strong economy, and the venues from which to extol it, his raucous campaign rallies.  “Historically, demagogic power wanes when seismic events overwhelm the existing moment,” said presidential historian Jon Meacham. “Pearl Harbor crushed America First; Bloody Sunday helped break the grip of Jim Crow. The pandemic may be the seismic shift, the mind-concentrating challenge, that ends Trump’s appeal beyond his hard-core base.”  Until now, one of Trump’s greatest skills as a politician has been to assert his own political reality, careening from headline to headline, while seemingly able to dodge scandals that would likely have ended any other political career.  His 2016 campaign was chaos and it worked, in part due to the unpopularity of Hillary Clinton, as well as outside help both foreign (Moscow) and domestic (James Comey). The Russia investigation shadowed him throughout his first two years in office. His response: an unrelenting assault from the Oval Office on the investigators and intelligence agencies.  In the end, special counsel Robert Mueller did not find that Trump conspired with Moscow to interfere with the election, but he also did not exonerate the president on possible charges of obstruction of justice. Trump claimed total victory. Several key aides ended up with guilty pleas, yet the president emerged relatively unscathed — only soon to enter another maelstrom over foreign help, this time his request to Ukraine to investigate his eventual Democratic opponent, Joe Biden.  Somehow, Trump's block-the-sun response made the third impeachment of a sitting president feel like both a foregone conclusion and an afterthought.  He had, again, survived. But the day after his acquittal also brought an ominous milestone: the nation’s first COVID-19 death.   ___   THE CRASH  When Trump made the trip to the Capitol for his State of the Union address in February, he was buoyed by polling that showed the impeachment proceedings had turned out to have little impact and Americans approved of his handling of the economy.  “Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again,” Trump declared.  The numbers did look good. And Trump aides were quick to credit his sweeping tax cut, one of his signature first-term achievements.  The unemployment rate was hovering at 3.5%, a level not seen since the 1960s. The stock market, one of the president’s favorite measures of economic success, was up roughly 20% from the previous year. And workers, particularly in lower-paying jobs, were seeing wages tick up.  Trump’s campaign advisers were giddy over signs that his message was resonating beyond the voters who had helped him win 2016. Advisers took note of the significant number of people requesting tickets to Trump rallies who hadn’t voted in the last presidential election.  Since 1956, in the 12 months before presidential elections, only one of nine incumbent presidents lost when unemployment fell over that year (Gerald Ford in 1976), and only one was reelected when it rose (Dwight Eisenhower in 1956).   Then came the virus.  In a matter of weeks, the economy collapsed. Unemployment skyrocketed to 14.7% and all the gains made by the stock market since he was elected were erased.  The virus-weakened economy has shown some signs of improvement but it is far from being healed. Unemployment has edged down to 10.2% — still just below the peak of U.S. joblessness in the Great Recession — and the S&P 500 reached a new high.  But the suffering for a huge slice of America remains great. More than 40% of recent layoffs are likely to become permanent job losses, by one recent estimate. The National Restaurant Association forecasts the industry could lose 5 to 7 million employees. And if the White House and Congress don’t come to terms on another aid package, the economy could go sideways after Labor Day.  Still, Trump’s backers believe he has an argument to make.  “I think the message needs to be in post-COVID times: Trump has got the energy, the stamina, the experience and track record to bring us back,” said Dan Eberhart, chief executive of oil services company Canary LLC and a major Republican donor.  But with less than 10 weeks to go until Election Day, Trump has spent an inordinate amount of time on squabbles and distractions, bashing the U.S. Postal Service, warning “suburban housewives” about perceived threats to their neighborhood idylls from affordable housing, lending credence to the right-wing QAnon conspiracy movement.  “I don’t know what persuadable voter is moved by anti-Post Office rhetoric,” Eberhart said. “We've got to get the closing message right.”   ___   THE NEWS CONFERENCE  Under a glistening ballroom chandelier, reporters packed into Trump’s Bedminster country club in New Jersey, waiting for the president to address shocking events that had unfolded more than 300 miles to the south on a sweltering day in August 2017.  A clash in Charlottesville, Virginia, between white supremacists and anti-racism demonstrators had left a young woman dead, mowed down by a neo-Nazi who drove his car into a crowd of counter protesters. Trump’s response: There was hatred and bigotry on “many sides.” Days later, in a Trump Tower news conference, he again declined to denounce solely the white supremacists, speaking of “very fine people on both sides.”  His equivocal words roiled the White House. Senior West Wing advisers threatened to quit. Republicans found their voices and condemned Trump.  It was more than just a moment. Trump, a billionaire by some accounts, sold himself to voters as an unlikely champion of the forgotten man who would “Make America Great Again,” a slogan that was read by many as a callback to a simpler — and whiter — era in the United States.  The president’s team showcased record low unemployment rates for African Americans and rising prosperity for minorities in the days before the pandemic. But his rhetoric and policies were viewed by many as offensive and, at times, racist.  There was his campaign kickoff suggestion that many Mexican immigrants were “rapists.” His claim that an Indiana-born judge couldn’t be impartial because of his Latino heritage. And there was the racist lie of birtherism — Trump’s false suggestions that President Barack Obama wasn’t born in the U.S. and thus wasn’t eligible to be president.  His moves to sharply curtail legal and illegal immigration became a frequent fault line for the administration. Thousands of Americans protested at airports in January 2017 when the White House enacted its first ban on travel from Muslim-majority countries, demonstrations that foreshadowed the uproar the following summer when the administration moved to forcibly separate migrant families at the southern border, leading to television images of weeping children pulled from their parents. And his closing — and ultimately failed — argument before the 2018 midterm elections was that dangerous caravans of migrants were headed for U.S. cities.  “He has made explicit what has been fueling American politics since the 1960s. He is saying the quiet parts out loud,” said Eddie Glaude, chair of the department of African American studies at Princeton University. “He has made direct appeals to white grievance, to white resentment. He has dwelled in the underbelly of American politics.”  Trump’s poll numbers, already wobbling, fell further in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer.  As protests calling for racial justice erupted, Trump leaned in on his law-and-order cry, depicting demonstrators as “thugs.” References to Lafayette Square, the park across from the White House, now evoke images of Trump posing in front of a damaged church holding up a Bible after officers forcefully routed demonstrators from the area.   ___   THE SUMMIT   Vladimir Putin smiled.  The world was watching a post-summit news conference by the American and Russian leaders in Helsinki in July 2018, and Trump had just publicly sided with Putin over his own intelligence agencies on the question of election interference.  The uproar was immediate. Even before Air Force One took off for Washington, Trump’s comments were condemned by Republicans and Democrats alike.  Trump’s deference to Putin, beyond reviving questions about the American leader’s possible ties to Moscow, illuminated his own brand of foreign policy, one that has strained ties with Western allies, in favor of transactional relationships and a warmth toward strongmen.  “Trump came into office believing that the cost of American world leadership was far greater than the benefits,” said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. “He sees allies as economic competitors rather than strategic partners.”  It all adds up to foreign policy wins, in the view of Trump supporters. After his prodding, more NATO members boosted spending on defense. The Islamic State, which once controlled 34,000 square miles in Syria and Iraq, has been defanged. And North Korea, which at the start of Trump’s term was widely regarded as the most volatile foreign policy issue on his plate, has remained relatively quiet.  “We have two foreign policy presidents with Trump,” said James Carafano, national security expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “There is the showman Trump and there is the serious foreign policy Trump. We spend way too much time focusing on the showmanship.”  Outside of Trump’s links to Putin, no relationship has attracted more scrutiny than the president’s hot-cold ties with China’s Xi Jinping.  Trump campaigned as a China hawk but, after being feted on an extravagant state visit to Beijing, his tone softened and he was eager to strike a new trade deal. And when the virus began to ignite around Wuhan, the president was reluctant to endanger negotiations and thus slow to criticize China.  Those days of expedient restraint are long gone, replaced by Trump’s determination to affix blame elsewhere for the pandemic that has imperiled his presidency. The coronavirus, in Trump’s telling, became the “China virus.”   ___   TRUTH AND CONSEQUENCE  No one knew when Trump arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina, on March 2, that it might turn out to be the last jam-packed, big stadium rally of his presidency.  At that point in the crisis — more than a week before the government recommended Americans sharply curtail activities to slow the spread of the virus — the number of U.S. infections had surpassed 100 and six people were confirmed dead. Trump assured the 9,600-person crowd that night he was leaning on the “greatest professionals in the world” to advise him.  “My job is to protect the health of American patients and Americans first, and that’s what I’ll do,” declared Trump. He added, “America is so resilient, we know what we’re doing, we have the greatest people on earth, the greatest health system on earth.”  Over the course of his presidency, Trump has leaned hard on florid overstatement, misdirection and out-right lies.  It was a pattern set on his first full day in office when he ordered his press secretary to exaggerate the crowd size at his 2017 inauguration. Since then, he incorrectly claimed the Mueller report “totally exonerated” him, he insisted his administration was “taxing the hell out of China” even as the trade deficit grew, and he promised a sweeping health care plan that has yet to emerge.  But his declaration at the Charlotte rally that he was getting advice from some of the greatest minds in medicine rang true. His coronavirus task force included Dr. Anthony Fauci, a renowned infectious disease expert, and Dr. Deborah Birx, who had worked with Fauci for years combating HIV/AIDS globally. Their presence gave the medical community hope that Trump would let the scientists lead him and the country through the crisis, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University.  Trump, in both private life and in the West Wing, has always made himself the center of power, the structure likened to “a wheel where all the spokes lead to the center, directly to the president,\" according to Chris Ruddy, the CEO of Newsmax and a longtime friend of Trump.  “There was no hierarchy at Trump Org and his White House mirrors that because, for Trump, it’s never been about organization, it is all about results,\" said Ruddy.  Reinforcing that, the Trump White House has seen an unprecedented amount of turnover among senior staff and Cabinet members, many of whom sharply criticized the president after leaving. And Trump soon began to break with the medical experts.  “He won the benefit of the doubt in the public health community because he surrounded himself with the people who would follow the science,” Gostin said. “The problem is, it doesn’t matter if you have the right people around you if you don’t listen to them.”  Trump, in defiance of federal guidelines, pushed for a rapid reopening of the economy even as public health experts warned him to go slow.  He promoted the use of the drug hydroxychloroquine as a “game changer,” and even used it himself, despite federal warnings against taking the malaria drug to combat COVID-19. He regularly asserts that the virus will soon “go away.” And he recently dismissed a warning by the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert Redfield, that the U.S. could be in for “the worst fall, from a public health perspective, we’ve ever had” if Americans don’t step up mitigation efforts, such as wearing masks.  “I think that we’re doing very well,” Trump said. “We’re on our way.”  That’s the bravado that Trump has projected throughout his presidency. He frequently proclaims that no president, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, has accomplished as much as he has.  He’s moved the federal judicial system far to the right with the appointment of two conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court and more than 200 federal judges to lower courts. And he’s built more than 200 miles of his planned U.S.-Mexico wall, a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign promise to slow illegal immigration.  But in the end, Trump has often ended up his own worst enemy, unwilling or unable to check his impulses. The campaign he now faces is less a choice between candidates than a referendum on himself, a weighting he will try to reverse before November.  And his most lasting legacy might be undermining Americans’ trust in institutions, said Brian Ott, who heads the communication department at Missouri State University and has done extensive research on the president’s social media rhetoric.  “He has waged war on science, fact and truth,” Ott said. “He has, in short, debased the office he holds and the entire nation with his endless lying.”   ___  Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire and Madhani at http://twitter.com/@AamerIsMad  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 51, "positive": 74, "negative": 44, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 5, "joy": 11, "anger": 42, "surprise": 42, "fear": 21, "trust": 31}, "metadata": ["photo", "donald", "trump", "coronavirus", "washington", "election", "american", "chaotic", "crisis", "virus", "republican", "presidential", "convince", "pandemic", "term", "enforce", "united", "___", "china", "europe", "global", "tom", "dictate", "venues", "campaign", "america", "politician", "headline", "hillary", "assault", "counsel", "joe", "impeachment", "capitol", "proceedings", "sweeping", "tax", "unemployment", "economic", "requesting", "economy", "recession", "congress", "labor", "right-wing", "voter", "clash", "declined", "african", "rhetoric", "mexican", "judge", "racist", "false", "barack", "obama", "eligible", "curtail", "illegal", "immigration", "ban", "families", "southern", "children", "ultimately", "caravans", "migrants", "studies", "appeals", "poll", "george", "protests", "calling", "russian", "democrats", "conservative", "rally", "professionals", "ceo", "unprecedented", "criticized", "reopening", "judicial", "supreme", "referendum", "university", "media", "waged", "twitter"]}, {"text": " Thank you for reading!

The move comes days after The Associated Press first reported on the U.S. government's secretive practice of detaining unaccompanied children in hotels before rapidly deporting them during the virus pandemic. Government data obtained by AP showed the U.S. had detained children nearly 200 times over two months in three Hampton Inn & Suites hotels in Arizona and two Texas border cities.  But the Trump administration has not said it will stop using hotels to detain children. The legal groups that sued Friday night said they still plan to fight the larger practice in court.  Their agreement only covers 17 children known to have been detained as of Thursday at the Hampton Inn in McAllen. After the hotel's owner said Friday it would end reservations of rooms used for child detention, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed the children from the hotel but refused to say where it had taken them.  Now, immigration authorities will transfer the children to shelters operated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, where they will have access to lawyers and should eventually be placed with family sponsors as they pursue asylum cases or other immigration relief to try to remain in the country. The legal groups withdrew their request Sunday for a temporary restraining order.  \"The children in this hotel averted disaster only because we happened to hear about them before they were deported, yet hundreds if not thousands of other children are being sent back to harm in secret,\" said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union. \"The government must stop expelling children in secret without giving them asylum hearings.\"  Federal anti-trafficking laws and a two-decade-old court settlement that governs the treatment of migrant children normally require that most children be sent to shelters operated by HHS. The shelters are licensed by the states where they're located and generally have bedrooms, recreation areas, and schooling.  Instead, more than 2,000 children have been expelled since March, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a declaration allowing immigration agencies to effectively shut down the asylum process out of concern about the spread of COVID-19.  The AP found that contractors paid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have held children as young as 1 in Hampton Inns. ICE called the contractors from MVM Inc. \"transportation specialists\" and refused to confirm whether they had passed FBI background checks or had backgrounds in child care. Instead, it said the contractors were \"non-law enforcement staff members trained to work with minors and to ensure that all aspects of the transport or stay are compliant\" with the court settlement known as the Flores agreement.  An advocate with the Texas Civil Rights Project who walked through the Hampton Inn in McAllen on July 17 saw people in scrubs going room to room on the fourth and fifth floors of the hotel caring for children. The advocate, Roberto Lopez, said he saw one small child holding onto a gate in a doorway as an adult on the other side played with him.  On Thursday, video posted by the project showed one of its lawyers trying to enter the fourth floor to find children. The video shows three men in plainclothes confronting him, then shoving him back and slamming him into an elevator wall.  The records indicate the children were not accompanied by a parent but don't say more about the circumstances of their crossing the border. In the past, some very young children have been brought by older siblings or other relatives. Others have been sent by parents waiting for their court dates in refugee camps on the U.S.-Mexico border with hopes they will be placed with relatives.  A spokeswoman for Hilton, which owns the Hampton Inn brand, said franchisees owned all three Hampton Inns and the others in Phoenix and El Paso, Texas, would also stop child detention in its hotels. Hilton said in a statement that the company expected all of its franchisees \"to reject business that would use a hotel in this way.\"  Andrea Ordin, a monitor appointed by the federal judge who oversees the Flores agreement, called on the U.S. government last week to stop detaining children in hotels, citing the lack of oversight and standards and the threat that children could suffer emotional and physical harm.  The Trump administration responded by questioning Ordin's authority to issue the report. Ordin's report was \"wholly outside the scope\" of her responsibility, wrote Sarah Fabian, a U.S. government lawyer who was previously criticized for suggesting in court that the government may not have to provide children with toothbrushes in Border Patrol custody.  Judge Dolly Gee, who oversees the Flores settlement, wrote Saturday that hotel detention does fall under the scope of Ordin's duties.

The Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) ruled that the government decision to strip 20-year-old Shamima Begum of her citizenship “did not make her stateless” as she was a citizen of Bangladesh by descent.  “The appellant (Begum) was in that situation as a result of her own choices, and of the actions of others, but not because of anything the Secretary of State had done,” said judge Doron Blum, referring to then-interior minister Sajid Javid.  The judgment was made despite SIAC finding that Begum could not have “a fair and effective appeal” against the decision as she is currently in a Syrian refugee camp.  Begum's lawyer Daniel Furner said she would “immediately initiate an appeal” against the decision.  “The logic of the decision will appear baffling, accepting as it does the key underlying factual assessments of extreme danger and extreme unfairness and yet declining to provide any legal remedy,” he said.  Begum, then 15, was one of three schoolgirls from Bethnal Green in east London who left home to join the militant group on February 17, 2015.  She claims she married a Dutch convert soon after arriving in IS-held territory. She was discovered, nine months pregnant, in a Syrian refugee camp in February last year.  Her newborn baby died soon after she gave birth. Two of her other children also died under IS rule.  Javid removed her British citizenship soon after amid an outcry led by right-wing media. He has said more than 100 people had been deprived of their British citizenship.  Begum took legal action against the Home Office last year.  Her lawyer, Tom Hickman, argued his client “is not considered a national of Bangladesh and was therefore rendered stateless” by the Home Office.  The decision was unlawful as it breached the Home Office's extraterritorial human rights policy by exposing Begum to “a real risk of death or inhuman or degrading treatment”, he argued.  In the next stage of the process, the court will have to decide if the government had legitimate national security grounds to prevent her from returning to the UK.

Earlier it was announced that Harvard will remain in “online only” status for the Fall 2020 semester. So foreign students enrolled at Harvard will be required to “attend” online classes from their home country, and not from housing near campus. With undergraduate tuition nearly $50,000, Harvard students might be forced into a decision to transfer to a school offering in-person instruction in order to remain in the US or to secure a visa to travel to the US. But, attempting to transfer this close to the scheduled start of classes would likely be extremely difficult.  Yale has also announced it will be holding most classes online.  Several weeks ago, all campuses of the California State University System announced that they would be offering only “on-ine courses” for the Fall 2020 semester.  The separate University of California system, comprised of nine campuses, has also announced that it will offer most courses online.  Stanford is taking an unusual approach, welcoming incoming freshmen to campus and as returning seniors on track to complete their degree. To maintain social distancing requirements, sophomores and juniors will be attending classes remotely.  DHS has already contemplated the possible use of limited “in person” classes as one way to “work around” the visa restrictions for foreign students. DHS will be requiring schools to certify on a student-by-student basis that the entire program is not available online, and that the student will be enrolled in at least one “in-person” course during the semester.  Some commentators on Twitter are pointing out the logistical and practical difficulties that some foreign students might face in trying to attend online from their home countries — including internet limitations, time-of-day differences, and inability to access some teaching devices employed inside the United States.  For example, in order to block certain content, China does not allow domestic users access to the Google “G Suite” administrator tools. If on-line instructions requires access to materials obtained through G Suite tools, students in China will likely be unable to access all the materials necessary to do the course work.  Foreign students now in the country who will be enrolled in an “onli0ne only” university in the fall must either transfer to a school with in-person instruction or depart the country; remaining in the country will subject them to removal proceedings.  Foreign students not now in the country will not be issued student visas to travel to the United States if their school is conducting “online only” instruction. The school must certify that the student is scheduled to attend at least one in-person class.  Schools are required to report to DHS if a student changes his course schedule after the beginning of the semester and adopts a schedule that consists only of on-line instruction.  This is likely to cause an outbreak of protests on college campuses this week, or will possibly contribute to greater protest activities in various cities around the country. I’ve always been struck by the fact that if you take a few minutes to scan the video of most protests marches that have taken place over the past four to five weeks a significant number of the protesters are college age or 20-somethings. So this announcement will likely be just one more “cause” for them on behalf of minority interests which they will claim are being attacked by the Trump Administration.  At the same time, this gives the Trump Administration more time and flexibility to take a closer look at the status of foreign students that have been admitted into the US on non-immigrant visas – an examination that Attorney General Barr commented on in an interview a couple weeks ago when addressing the national security threats to the United States, primarily from China.

The mother-of-one's husband Richard Ratcliffe blasted the UK Government today for not doing more to get her home.  Yesterday, US Navy veteran Michael White was freed from prison in Iran in return for the release of two Iranian prisoners.  Her husband Richard Ratcliffe told The Times: 'She asked me how is it that the US, which doesn't even have diplomatic relations with Iran, has three people out in the last year and we have none? What on earth are they doing?  'This is a hostage situation and it is not helped by the government pretending it is not.'  Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been in prison in the country since her arrest at Tehran's Imam Khomeini airport while travelling with her young daughter, Gabriella, to meet her parents in April 2016.  Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 42, is expected to speak to foreign secretary Dominic Raab over the phone to ask him what his plans to help her out of prison are  When she speaks to Mr Raab she 'will be asking him not if he cares but does he have a plan,' Mr Ratcliffe added.  He claimed his wife was being used as a political bargaining chip as the Iranian government tried to force the UK to pay the £400million debt owed for a shipment of tanks in the 1980s.  Mr Ratcliffe said Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab had admitted this was the case privately, but neither have made the information public.  The Government has not paid the debt because of issues with how much interest is now owed, something that is currently going through British courts, he added.  The UK would also be unable to directly send the money to the country without breaking US banking sanctions. But the countries have allegedly discussed paying the money in kind through humanitarian aid.  Her husband Richard Ratcliffe (pictured with the couple's daughter Gabriella) warned the chance to secure her release has 'almost gone'  Meanwhile Mr White was flown out of Iran yesterday, a day after an Iranian scientist arrived in Iran following his release by US immigration authorities.  An Iranian-American doctor convicted for export violations in Atlanta was also freed.  Switzerland has confirmed it helped to mediate the exchange.  Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, suggested similar exchanges could be arranged for others held by Iran. 'This can happen for all prisoners,' Mr Zarif tweeted. 'No need for cherry picking.'  Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is hoping to be updated on Saturday on the progress of a bid for clemency but her husband said it feels like 'momentum has stalled'.  She had been in Iran's notorious Evin prison since 2016 but was released on furlough on March 17 as the Covid-19 pandemic swept through the country.  Her family were hopeful that she might be permanently released as part of an amnesty for 3,000 prisoners at the end of Ramadan, which was announced by the country's supreme leader.  But more than two weeks after Eid, her husband said: 'The moment of opportunity is now almost gone.'  Mr Ratcliffe said he believed his wife's clemency is being blocked by Iran's Revolutionary Guard despite her case having the support of the country's judiciary.  Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been in prison in the country since her arrest at Tehran's Imam Khomeini airport while travelling with her young daughter, Gabriella (pictured together), to meet her parents in April 2016  He said: 'We should be getting an update from the prosecutor's office tomorrow, though in light of the games over the past couple of weeks, (we) are not holding our breath.'  He added: 'Nazanin has asked to speak to the Foreign Secretary to find out just how the UK is getting her home.  'It has felt for a while like momentum has stalled, and that the moment of opportunity is now almost gone.'  Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison over allegations of plotting to overthrow the Tehran government.  She has been afforded diplomatic protection by the UK Government, which states that she is innocent and that her treatment by Iran failed to meet obligations under international law.  It comes a month after Mr Ratcliffe told Good Morning Britain his wife was enjoying spending time with her daughter on video calls since being released on furlough.  He revealed that she has been playing dolls with her five-year-old daughter Gabriella over Skype.  Speaking on GMB he said: 'We are on the cusp of potentially good news.  Mr Ratcliffe, his daughter Gabriella and his mother Barbara, ahead of a meeting with British Prime Boris Johnson at 10 Downing Street in London on January 23  'Nazanin's lawyer was being brought down in front of the prosecutor's office tomorrow to get a decision on her clemency. So she could be on that list, we don't know yet.'  Mr Ratcliffe said legally his wife should be on the list \"because she meets all the criteria\", adding that the family is \"hopeful\".  'Nazanin's been under lockdown for eight weeks,' he said today. 'No one can visit her because she's a high level political prisoner.'  But he added: 'It's lovely to be able to speak on Skype to her.' And he said that during the disruption of the coronavirus crisis, their daughter has been able to play with her mother over video chat.  'For her the disruption has been mitigated by having Nazanin on the phone and playing dolls with her on Skype,' he said.  Mr Ratcliffe said that although he felt 'euphoric' when he heard his wife could finally be released, he is preparing for the worst.  Pictured: Richard and his daughter, Gabriella, speak on Skype to Nazanin who is being held in Iran  'It would be great if we could become a normal family,' he said. 'There's a chance we'll find out in the next couple of weeks if it doesn't happen in the next couple of weeks we need to think it hasn't happened.  'Part of me needs to prepare for the fact she might sent back to prison and then keep on campaigning and pressuring the government.'  He renewed his call for the government to do everything they can for his wife, despite Boris Johnson being consumed by the coronavirus pandemic.  'He's got a lot going on and the government always does have,' he told the programme.  'It's clear the Foreign Secretary is following this case closely. When I met the Prime Minister back in January he was clear he wanted to do everything he could but after four years part of me doesn't trust that it will happen.'

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear two cases involving Trump administration policies at the U.S.-Mexico border: one about a policy that makes asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for U.S. court hearings and a second about the administration's use of money to fund the border wall.The justices' decision to hear the cases continues its practice of reviewing lower court rulings that have found President Donald Trump's immigration policies illegal over the past four years.Most notably, the high court reviewed and ultimately upheld Trump's travel ban on visitors from some largely Muslim countries. In June, the court kept in place legal protections for immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.The justices will not hear either new case until 2021, and the outcome of the presidential election could make the cases go away, or at least reduce their significance. If Democrat Joe Biden wins the White House, he could rescind Trump's \"Migrant Protection Protocols\" policy. In the border wall case, much of the money has already been spent and wall constructed.The court has allowed both policies to continue even after they were held illegal by lower courts, a sign the challengers could face long odds when the justices ultimately decide the cases.The Trump administration policy known informally as \"Remain in Mexico\" began in January 2019. It became a key pillar of the administration's response to an unprecedented surge of asylum-seeking families from Central American countries at the border, drawing criticism for having people wait in highly dangerous Mexican cities.Lower courts found that the policy is probably illegal. But earlier this year the Supreme Court stepped in to allow the policy to remain in effect while a lawsuit challenging it plays out in the courts.More than 60,000 asylum-seekers were returned to Mexico under the policy. The Justice Department estimated in late February that there were 25,000 people still waiting in Mexico for hearings in U.S. court. Those hearings were suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic.The Trump administration told the high court in April that the \"program has been extremely effective at reducing the strain on the United States' immigration detention capacity and improving the efficient resolution of asylum applications.\"In a statement after the high court agreed to take the case, Judy Rabinovitz, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which is challenging the policy, called the policy \"illegal and depraved.\"\"The courts have repeatedly ruled against it, and the Supreme Court should as well,\" she said.The high court also agreed to hear the Trump administration's appeal of a lower court ruling that it improperly diverted money to build portions of the border wall with Mexico.The high court has previously allowed construction to continue, even after a federal appeals court ruled in June that the administration had illegally sidestepped Congress in transferring $2.5 billion in Defense Department funds.Dissenting from a July order that allowed construction to continue, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that the court's action \"I fear, may operate, in effect, as a final judgment.\"The case has its origins in the 35-day partial government shutdown that started in December of 2018. Trump ended the shutdown after Congress gave him approximately $1.4 billion in border wall funding, but that was far less than the $5.7 billion he was seeking. Trump then declared a national emergency to take cash from other government accounts to use to construct sections of the wall.At the time, the money Trump identified included $2.5 billion in Defense Department money, $3.6 billion from military construction funds and $600 million from the Treasury Department's asset forfeiture fund.The case before the Supreme Court involves just the $2.5 billion in Defense Department funds.___Associated Press reporter Elliot Spagat contributed to this report from San Diego.

The requests are part of the annual H-1B work-visa process that is run by the USCIS at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and which is used by Fortune 500 companies to replace skilled American professionals with blocs of imported graduates.  The government process of importing H-1B workers is continuing despite the huge wave of layoffs that have hit many white-collar workers in the auto industry, in Silicon Valley, and even in hospitals.  Congress gives companies 85,000 H-1B visas each year. So the 275,000 applications will be put into a lottery and picked for the 85,000 visas by luck, not by skill or salaries.  The 85,000 new visa workers will be allowed to begin their reserved multiyear jobs in October, regardless of the unemployment rate for American graduates. Companies are not obliged to interview or hire Americans before they import H-1B workers. Universities, non-profit hospitals, and research centers are allowed to hire as many H-1Bs as they wish.  So far, President Donald Trump has not intervened to stop the white-collar jobs giveaway, despite his Inauguration Day promise of “Hire American,” and despite his weak polling support among college graduates in suburbia.  The H-1B program is just part one of many visa-worker programs that keep a population of up to 1.5 million foreign white-collar workers in the starter jobs that are needed by U.S. graduates to get into a field and to gain the experience necessary for promotion. For example, the multiyear H-1B visas allow roughly 900,000 foreign contract workers to hold white-collar jobs in the United States.  It’s April 1st. The greatest #AprilFoolsDay joke played on the American people will be by the US government as it prepares to select 85,000 H-1B visa applications today via the lottery, at a time of record level unemployment & a global pandemic. — U.S. Tech Workers (@USTechWorkers) April 1, 2020  The agency released little data about the people being imported for the jobs or their claimed skill levels:  Nearly 275,000 unique registrations were submitted during the initial registration period. Roughly 46% of all registrations were for prospective beneficiaries with U.S. advanced degrees. There were more than 40,000 registration accounts created, and nearly 81% of submitted registrations were for potential beneficiaries from India (67.7%) and China (13.2%).  Officials are releasing less information about the H-1B workers than they did in 2017. For example, the agencies are no longer releasing the addresses where the H-1Bs are scheduled to work. The address data for the 2017 H-1Bs was released, and it allowed groups to show how many H-1Bs were working in the office buildings of Fortune 500 countries.  The USCIS press release also did not describe the skill levels of the H-1B workers, nor the promised pay levels.  In 2017, the federal data showed that employers asked for 83,307 workers for jobs in New York. Just 65 percent were rated as “Entry-Level” or “Qualified” workers. Just 11.4 percent were rated as “Experienced,” and a mere six percent were rated as “Fully Competent.”  The 2017 data also showed that 52 percent of the 2017 H-1B workers were supposed to be paid less than $80,000 for jobs in New York.  USCIS did not say how many H-1B workers are being sought by companies that lease their H-1B workers to Fortune 500 companies.  This staffing business has converted the H-1B program into the primary supplier of gig workers to the white-collar technology, banking, and insurance sectors. This massive supply of contingent workers raises stock values by lowering salaries that are paid to millions of American professionals.  Many of the H-1B applicants are foreign graduates who are already working in American jobs via the huge Optional Practical Training (OPT) and Curricular Practical Training (CPT) programs. These master degree programs allow colleges and universities — elite, average, and low-quality storefront colleges — to provide access to work permits to almost any foreigner who pays their tuition fees.  Forty-six percent of the 275,000 H-1B applicants hold “U.S. advanced degrees,” according to USCIS. Those numbers suggest that up to 126,000 resident OPT and CPT workers are asking for H-1B visas.  Most of the graduates in the OPT and CPT programs hope to win slots in the H-1B programs because it allows them to get better jobs and hugely valuable green cards.  The USCIS noted that most of the 275,000 applicants are Indians.  The 67.7 percent number indicates that 187,000 applicants are from India, underlining the scale of the U.S.-India Outsourcing Economy that has pushed a huge number of American graduates out of decent jobs in the technology, banking, and insurance industries. Nationwide, up to one million Indians hold white-collar jobs in the United States via the H-1B, OPT, CPT, L-1, H4EAD, and TN visa programs.  The growing role of Indian workers and managers in American offices has sparked widespread charges of favoritism and numerous lawsuits claiming discrimination against American graduates  Indian hiring managers will sell jobs to Indian job applicants for $5,000 to $10,000, one Indian H-1B told Breitbart News, describing the lucrative exchange of enormous peer pressure on honest Indian managers. “If you are honest, you can’t survive — you will become a bottleneck in the chain. … [Senior managers] will fire you.”  America managers do not sell jobs, he said, adding, “There are very few honest Indian managers — maybe one in a million. “  Health insurance execs discriminated against Americans by hiring more-costly Indian H-1Bs, says lawsuit.  The case spotlights the tech sector's preference for compliant Indian contractors over indep. US professionals.  So more H-1Bs = less tech innovationhttps://t.co/qoENwyO6X7 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 9, 2020  The work visas will not be sent to the lottery winners for several weeks after the companies submit petition packages with justifications for each visa. The deadline for submitting the petitions is June 30.  Those justifications include a so-called Labor Condition Application (LCA) document approved by the Department of Labor. The LCAs describe the intended job for each H-1B worker. Business advocates use the LCA process to claim that imported workers do not displace Americans.  But the LCA process does not require the companies to show that Americans cannot be hired for the job. Also, the LCA documents are rubber-stamped by the department. A department spokesman told Breitbart News:  Under current law, “the Secretary of Labor shall review such an [LCA] application only for completeness and obvious inaccuracies” and, unless the application is incomplete or obviously inaccurate, the Department must certify the LCA within seven days of receiving the employer’s application. [Emphasis added]  The current head of DHS, Chad Wolf, formerly served as a lobbyist for NASSCOM, which is the major trade group for the U.S. and Indian outsourcing companies that imports most of the H-1B gig workers. The group’s mix of Indian and U.S. companies use the H-1B program to extract salaries and wealth from the American college graduate class, and they split the gains among both countries’ executives and investors, plus the visa workers, their managers, and India’s government.  NASSCOM has additional lobbyists, according to federal records in Washington, DC. They have included John Engler, the former GOP governor of Michigan, and Spencer Abraham, a former GOP senator from Michigan. Abraham lost his Senate seat in 2000 after opposing a pro-American immigration reform bill. Since then, Michigan’s immigrant population has helped elect Democrats to Abraham’s former seat.  American professionals have organized to lobby against the H-1B program via the American Workers Coalition, U.S. TechWorkers, ProUSworkers, and White Collar Workers of America.  The new TechsUnite.US site was created to help U.S. graduates anonymously collaborate while shielded by encryption.  In turn, these groups are backed up by a few sites that track the scale and location of the outsourcing industry in each legislator’s district. The sites include SAITJ.org and H1BFacts.com. “The scope of this thing is really unbelievable,” said one researcher.  Other sites document the conflicts created by diverse foreign business practices in the United States. The non-political MyVisaJobs.com site also provides much information about H-1B outsourcing and green card rewards in multiple industries.

Biden both want everyone in their vast nations to mask up in public.  Mr. Putin issued a mandate requiring masks on public transport and other public spaces last week, as the coronavirus swamps his country and Europe at large.  Mr. Biden, the Democratic nominee, is pushing for something similar in the U.S., calling for a “nationwide mandate” that amounts to a face-covering requirement on federal property and interstate transportation and a plea for every governor to issue a mask mandate.  If governors won’t do it, Mr. Biden plans to lean on mayors, hoping to make mask-wearing a social norm from coast to coast.  The push is winning support from public health experts — including Dr. Anthony Fauci — who say people need to buckle down as the coronavirus permeates the country and swamps Europe.  The U.S. is seeing record numbers of daily cases but it’s not just from increased testing — hospital visits are peaking in over a dozen states.  Unlike his Democratic foe, President Trump says he wants Americans to make their own choices as they navigate the pandemic. He’s presiding over campaign crowds with sporadic mask use and ridiculing California for its strict rules.  “You cannot, under any circumstances, take it off. You have to eat through the mask,” Mr. Trump told Arizona supporters at a recent campaign rally.  Health experts say masks are a simple but effective tool in blocking infectious droplets, especially if someone is infected and doesn’t know it as they talk, cough or sneeze in public. Even if a mask-wearer does become infected, some scientists believe a face covering may reduce the amount of virus they’re exposed to, given them a better chance of having a mild case.  Mr. Biden initially pitched a sweeping federal mandate ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August.  But the effort ran into immediate questions — vice-presidential pick Kamala Harris said no one would be punished for violating the mandate, dubbing it a federal “standard,” while Mr. Biden said he believed he had the legal power to enact one but couldn’t guarantee it.  “It isn’t clear that the executive branch has such broad authority,” said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law. “If you’re on federal property, you can probably do that — if you’re on an airplane, or on Amtrak.”  Thirty-three states, plus D.C., have mask orders in place, according to AARP.  The mandates differ but generally apply to indoor public spaces like stores and restaurants or public transportation and offer exceptions for people disabilities or specific circumstances, like exercising or eating.  There are gaps in mask usage, however, including in states that have seen a spike in cases and deaths in recent weeks.  North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican, has pleaded with residents to mask up but will not mandate it.  Mr. Biden’s authority to twist governors’ arms would only extend so far, according to experts.  For instance, it would be difficult for his administration to threaten state or localities with a loss of funding for refusing to institute a mask mandate, according to Mr. Blackman. A federal appeals court earlier this year ruled against Mr. Trump‘s push to withhold federal funds from “sanctuary cities” that don’t cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.  Heavy-handed efforts to induce mask-wearing might also backfire, hardening the resistance of people who see government pandemic rules as overreach.  Mr. Trump officially recommends mask-wearing in cases where people cannot socially distance. But he hasn’t promoted their use and questioned whether waiters are spreading germs by fiddling with their masks while serving food.  Mr. Trump appeared shocked to see Fox News personality Laura Ingraham wearing a mask at his Michigan rally on Friday.  “Are you wearing a mask?” the president called out incredulously to Ms. Ingraham, who was standing below the stage in the crowd. “I can’t recognize you. Is that a mask? I’ve never seen her in a mask. Look at you. Whoa! Whoa!”  Mr. Trump told the crowd, “She’s being very politically correct.”  “Oh,” Mr. Trump said, “she’s being very politically correct.”  • Dave Boyer contributed to this report.

Tom Cotton (R-AR) in an interview on Breitbart News Sunday with special guest host Joel Pollak.  Sotomayor dissented in the Supreme court’s 5-4 decision in Wolf v. Cook County, upholding the federal government’s authority to restrict immigration from foreigners who would become financial burdens on taxpayers as “public charges.”  “I fear that this disparity in treatment erodes the fair and balanced decisionmaking process that this Court must strive to protect,” wrote Sotomayor, who was appointed by Barack Obama, adding, “They upend the normal appellate process, putting a thumb on the scale in favor of the party that won a stay.”  Sotomayor declared, “It is hard to say what is more troubling: that the Government would seek this extraordinary relief seemingly as a matter of course, or that the Court would grant it.”  Cotton said, “I’ve read [Sonia Sotomayor’s] dissent, and this is a classic example of the president’s critics and opponents projecting onto him exactly what they and the other critics are doing.”   LISTEN:  “So [Sonia Sotomayor] accused the Republican-appointed justices on the Supreme Court of taking extraordinary steps to side with the administration and allow them to implement their agenda when, in fact, it is all of these resistance judges appointed by Barack Obama or Bill Clinton or even Jimmy Carter who are issuing these crazy nationwide injunctions without a factual record in front of them that are actually taking unprecedented action,” added Cotton.  “The Supreme Court is simply stepping in and saying they’ve had enough with a single judge who’s probably been shopped at for by left-wing plaintiffs shutting down what it is a basic regulation that should move forward.”  Immigration should not bring in those who will be burdens on government-driven welfare programs, said Cotton.  “On the merits of this case, the so-called ‘public charge rule,’ that immigrants should not be allowed into this country if they will become a public charge, they will use welfare or use food stamps or use Medicaid, that is probably the oldest principle of American immigration law,” determined Cotton.  Cotton continued, “You know in the 18th and 19th century, we didn’t have much in the way of immigration law, certainly not like we have now. There were very few laws at all governing immigration in those days. One of those laws, though, is that you cannot come to this country and become a burden on the public treasury.”  Cotton concluded, “I mean, that’s just plain common sense, and it’s high time that the Trump administration was allowed to implement their regulation that has been blocked by all these left-wing resistance judges.”  Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Eastern.

Roosevelt and Richard Nixon. He has delivered on his promises of tax cuts, deregulation, drastic reduction of illegal immigration, better trade arrangements, constitutionalist federal judges, renovation of the military, the smashing of ISIL, revival of nuclear non-proliferation in respect of Iran and North Korea (which had swindled his predecessors), elimination of unemployment and net oil imports, reduction of poverty and violent crime and expansion of manufacturing and of the workforce. Trump has effectively, if histrionically at times, managed the public health crisis and produced an economic assistance package that will provide a swift restoration of pre-coronavirus prosperity. His punch-drunk Democratic opponents, to avoid the nomination of a raving Marxist, have had to elevate a spavined wheel-horse and they are heading for the last round-up.

Conrad Black  Trump’s domestic enemies have the excuse of resenting Trump’s bone-crushing defeat of them. We have no excuse in Canada for not recognizing the resurrection of American strength. Trump’s grievance was not with Canada, but Mexico, for enticing away American factories, exporting back into the U.S., incentivizing the non-repatriation of American corporate profits from Mexico and facilitating the illegal entry into the U.S. of up to a million unskilled migrants a year. He has resolved all that. And I can assure John Ibbitson that Trump is staunchly loyal to his friends. His public personality is an acquired taste, or not, though his talents as a showman, which is always important in the U.S., are considerable. No one speaks of China’s impending elevation to primacy over America now. Canadians of all people should have noticed this, and contemplation of the Chinese alternative, especially after its shameful performance in the coronavirus crisis, is a sobering thought.

But she was still shocked when one of the deadliest school shootings in history took place in her own community.  Corin, then 17, survived the Marjory Stoneman Douglas School Shooting in Parkland, Florida, in 2018. Seeing her school’s name alongside other locations of tragic mass shootings — Columbine High School, Sandy Hook Elementary School, and the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado — would define the rest of her life.  “We were the generation that grew up post-9/11 in a country filled with violence,” said Corin, who is one of the founding members of March For Our Lives, a student-run gun violence prevention organization founded in the wake of the Parkland shooting.  Born between the years of 1996 and 2010, GenZers have grown up in an era where gun violence is frequent, immigration is a hotly debated topic and the deteriorating climate is acknowledged as a crisis. They are now coming of age during a global pandemic that is disproportionately affecting black and brown communities, and as protesters take to the streets to call out racism and police brutality.  One in 10 eligible voters this November will be a member of GenZ.  Certain members of GenZ, including Corin, are adamant that the time for revolution — in the streets, online and at the polls — is now. They believe that they are uniquely positioned to affect change because of social media and the way it unites the generation.   By the numbers  GenZ is the most racially and ethnically diverse generation yet. According to Pew Research, only a slight majority (52%) of post-millennials are non-Hispanic white, compared to a larger majority (61%) for millennials 10 years earlier.  Some experts suggested that GenZ is particularly accepting because of the way that diversity has been normalized within their generation since birth.  “This generation has grown up in a world that is considerably different than GenX, even Millennials. They’ve had friends, families, relationships with people who have been different than you based on whatever the difference is: socioeconomic, gender identity, and therefore, they’ve noticed that those friends and family members, even acquaintances are really no different than you as a generation. That is part of the reason they’ve been filled with so much empathy,” John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics, told CNN.  And while GenZers have grown up in an increasingly more diverse environment, they have also come of age amid political division and violence.  In November 2016, right around the time that the oldest members of GenZ were starting college, America was more politically divided than during years prior, according to Pew Research. Pew Research found that both party coalitions have been reshaped by an aging US population, levels of higher education, and racial and ethnic diversity. On the eve of the 2016 election, the parties were moving further and further apart. The Democratic voter base was becoming younger and diverse quickly, while the GOP voter base was aging, but diversifying more slowly.  In 2019, there were more mass shootings than days in the year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, an online database that has tracked American gun violence since 2014. And, while this generation is the most diverse, in 2019, the likelihood of encountering gun violence differs by race. According to Giffords Law Center, the legal and policy oriented wing of Giffords, an organization dedicated to research around gun violence prevention, in 2019, unarmed Black civilians were about five times more likely to be shot and killed than unarmed white civilians.  Some researchers suggest that gun violence has been considered an everyday element of life in black and brown communities, and so it has been ignored for years, often seen as an issue separate from mass shootings. But, as GenZ gun violence prevention activists point out, when they address gun violence in 2020, they are referring to both rare mass shootings, as well as prevalent gun violence in communities of color.  ‘GenZ was woken up earlier’  Eva Lewis, 21, first recognized a need for change after the death of Trayvon Martin, who was shot by a neighborhood watch-guard in Stanford, Florida, in 2012. Lewis, who was 13-years-old at the time, described his death as “traumatic.”  Lewis lives on the South Side of Chicago, where she sees “chaos left and right.” Growing up, she attended a predominately white school on the North Side. Until Martin’s death, Lewis had a hard time understanding that the discrimination she felt growing up was racism, she told CNN.  “When Trayvon Martin was killed, it clicked,” she said, explaining that she became hyper curious about the structures in place around her that perpetuated a culture that was supposedly outlawed half a century prior.  Chicago has been historically segregated, even after the tumultuous civil rights movement of the 1960s. A large part of racial inequality in the city has been exacerbated by segregated schools — according to NPR, just over 10 years ago, a federal judge lifted an order that mandated Chicago Public Schools to integrate by race. Ever since, the schools have been even more separated by race.  “For me, being a GenZ-er that is a black woman, and growing up in a matriarchy with a single mother, to hear and see the stories of what my family went through down South parallel to my own life is tiring,” Lewis said.  “We’re tired of waiting,” Lewis said. “Being young and seeing the implications of colonialism on our parents and grandparents, hearing about black death every day in Chicago, it’s traumatic. [There’s] only so much time you can go through until you react. I don’t want to be older and tired. I want to be lively.”  Lewis is far from alone.  Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, the director of the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts, said that in previous years, youth dissatisfaction led to inaction. But in 2018, with the March For Our Lives, “fed-up” members of GenZ took action in high numbers, leading to the highest youth voter turnout in a quarter century during the 2018 midterms.  “This builds on a lot of people’s work,” Kawashima-Ginsberg said, adding that politicians like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have run on platforms committed to diversity and inclusion.  Kawashima-Ginsberg also noted that the Occupy Wallstreet movement spearheaded mostly by millennials in 2011 brought more progressive conversations into the mainstream. Occupy Wallstreet called out issues of economic injustice, focusing on the unequal distribution of wealth between the top 1% of income earners and the rest, as well as the war in Afghanistan, and climate change. The movement was purposefully leaderless and decentralized, serving as a catchall for disaffected young Americans.  “GenX used to receive the message that we all have an equal chance. Now we know that we don’t,” Kawashima-Ginsberg said. “GenZ was woken up much earlier.”  From fighting for immigration reform, to walking out of school to raise awareness around gun violence prevention, and striking from school on Fridays to save the climate, in the past decade, many GenZ-ers across the country have expressed their dismay with a culture that tolerates violence and are committed to learning how to combat injustice.  “We are all educating ourselves, especially in the wake of the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others, on racial injustices, especially injustices toward the black community. We are beginning to understand just how different a lot of our lives and upbringings are. Even in the last two weeks, I’ve seen so many people that weren’t formally engaged in politics or civil rights take a step in the ring and say, I need to be a part of this fight because I’ve been lucky enough not to understand,” Corin said.  During the summer of 2018, Corin led March For Our Lives’ cross-country voter registration tour, Road to Change, to mobilize young voters. From connecting with young people across the country, Corin saw that GenZ was tired of growing up with active shooter drills and the constant fear that their community could be next. Corin started the March For Our Lives chapter network, which provides tools and resources to groups of organizers nationwide who mobilize their communities on the issue of gun violence prevention. The network uses social media to connect across the country.  As Della Volpe notes, “little victories,” have been made in the wake of Parkland and the March For Our Lives in 2018, including the high youth voter turnout in 2018, which helped elect young politicians like Ocasio-Cortez and Pressley.  Since 2018, many gun violence prevention laws have been passed at the state level. Since Parkland, 137 gun safety bills were passed in 32 states and Washington, DC, according to Giffords. In 2019 alone, 70 gun safety bills were signed. And youth support was a driving force behind the Green New Deal, a sweeping policy proposal to combat climate change that has stalled in the Senate.   But more work remains.  Now, as nationwide protests in response to the death of George Floyd continue for a third week, members of GenZ are saying that this time, the energy feels different.  The protests pushing for racial justice following Floyd’s killing at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis have been highly localized across the country. Kawashima-Ginsberg noted that pressuring your local police office to enact change is different than protesting President Donald Trump or a border wall at the national level.  ‘We are the social media revolution’  In 2019, young Americans felt anxiety as much as joy, according to the Harvard IOP’s Spring 2019 youth poll. About half of young Americans reported experiencing anxiety, correlating to the number of young people who fear for the state of our country, according to the same poll.  Oftentimes, GenZ is referred to as iGen, because of the generation’s dependence on social media and technology.  Leah Shafer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education suggests that the rise in feelings of anxiety or worry among teens correlates with a rise in teens’ dependence on social media and technology.  But technology also has its benefits for youth organizers.  “Digital media can be a space that scrambles geography and racial backgrounds by bringing people together around shared interests rather than where you live. We see that partnerships are emerging,” Henry Jenkins, a communications professor at the University of Southern California and the author “By Any Media Necessary: The New Youth Activism,” told CNN, using the March For Our Lives as an example.  Jenkins noted that while the March For Our Lives movement began in an affluent, mostly white community in Florida, March For Our Lives organizers made the effort to connect with members of the Black Lives Matter movement and those who face police violence and gun violence in their everyday life as the movement went national. While members of GenZ growing up in different areas may be different, “they formed alliances and called attention to the shared and overlapping identities that they had,” Jenkins said.  While Corin recognizes that young people have been at the forefront of social change for generations, from her experiencing connecting with GenZers all over the country, she believes her generation is uniquely positioned to make change because of social media and the level of empathy it enables.  “GenZ not only has social media tools to connect with one another in an instant, but we also have this culture where we’re all so willing to fight for each other. This is one of the most understanding and empathetic generations we’ve ever seen. We are making this a collective fight and we understand that if something doesn’t affect us immediately, it might affect people in our community or people in our generation that we might not even know,” Corin said, speaking to the ability of GenZ-ers to stand up for each other online.  Nia White, a 17-year-old growing up in Brooklyn, NY, echoed Corin’s sentiments.  “Prior to this revolution, ’cause that’s what it is, civil rights organizations worked together but didn’t necessarily see eye to eye all the time. Now we’re all on the same consensus and realizing, it doesn’t matter how we’re going about it, but what the end result is supposed to be, which is freedom for everyone,” White told CNN.  “We are the social media revolution. We are the social media generation. We grew up with Facebook, Instagram, every sort of platform. When you see black people, black men, black children, black women… just people of color in general gunned down, choked down, shot up in their own communities and you seeing nothing done about it, it gets you so frustrated,” White said of the violence she sees online.  “Violence is everywhere,” she said, adding that her community in East New York is prone to gun and police violence. Similar to Corin and Lewis, the first protest she attended was in response to gun violence.  Violence did not start with GenZ. But because of social media, perpetual violence is more visible. As a result of social media, Jenkins explains, incidents that may have previously been considered isolated issues have been brought together under a singular hashtag, such as #BlackLivesMatter.  “Social media didn’t cause that awareness, but enabled that awareness,” Jenkins said, adding that the ability for members of GenZ to document their own lives and experiences, and the accessibility of social media platforms, helped GenZers express themselves and what they were going through in real time.  Jenkins added that GenZ uses the same social media platforms to tell their friends what they’re up to on a Friday night as they do to tell stories of injustice. While GenZ may use Snapchat to post a selfie, GenZers now also use the app to document political opinions and theories for how to dismantle systemic racism.  But while White remains frustrated by the perpetual violence she witnesses both online and in her own community, she is optimistic about GenZ as change-makers.  “We are able to amplify ourselves. Everyone is on the same page. We are on the same wavelength, and give each other information, then you’re more likely to go out and give to others,” she said. “We are in the social media stage where it’s like, everyone is for everyone. Whether it’s on Facebook, Instagram, etc. we make sure these messages go viral. This movement is more than me. It’s more than any of us now. It’s worldwide now.”  (Copyright (c) 2020 CNN.

Disclaimer: We at ANP encourage people not to panic, that affects thinking, forces people to make bad decisions and does absolutely nothing to help any situation. We at ANP also do not think the sky is falling. The world is not ending and every person in America is not going to become infected with COVID-19 or any possible mutations that may occur.  With that out of the way, we do believe the time to start preparing to self-quarantine, has passed, so those that haven’t made arrangements to get prepared to hunker down within the home for an undetermined amount of time , needs to consider doing so right now.  We understand some people cannot avoid leaving their homes, do to work, schooling, etc…… and those people should take the proper precautions when outside the home to limit the possibility of contagion. That would include wearing gloves when out and about, avoiding crowded places, dining in the home rather than outside the home, and basically using common sense.  For those that can work from home or do not need to work anymore, prepare to self-quarantine.  Not only because we do not know enough about this new Coronavirus to be complacent. Also not only because of the lack of proper data of infection, being that people can be sick, and asymptomatic for between 14-21 days, and still be infectious.  The fear and anger, represented perfectly by a flight having to be diverted to Denver after passengers became unruly because someone coughed and sneezed, is a huge cause for concern as more people do become infected across the country.  So, we at ANP do not want you to panic, but others are doing so, and those people can, and usually will, become dangerous to others.  (ANP NEEDS YOUR HELP- Due to recent medical expenses, All News Pipeline will need financial help in the months ahead. If you like stories like this, please consider donating to ANP to help keep us in this ‘Info-war’ for America at a time of systematic censorship and corruption.)  PREPARE A HEALTHY QUARANTINE ZONE  Look at the U.S. Congress where two sitting members are already self-quarantining because they came into contact with a man that later was confirmed to have the COVID-19 Coronavirus. Congress is also considering recessing for an undetermined amount of time as members fear contracting the virus and bringing it home. Hundreds of D.C. residents are also being urged to self-quarantine because they attended a church where the rector was confirmed to have the Coronavirus.  In New York, the governor has urged residents to avoid “crowded spaces,” but, as is typical with politicians, he then decreed that the mass transit, which is nothing but crowded spaces, did not need to be shut down.  According to recent reports, U.S. hospitals do not have enough “ICU beds or ventilators to deal with even a moderate coronavirus outbreak,” and some reports indicate that hospitals are preparing for a possible 96 million coronavirus infections and 480,000 deaths.  The aforementioned and a host of other reasons are why any and all preventative measures to protect yourself and your family and/or close friends, should be taken…. right now.  Recent I wrote a piece about how to create a quarantine room in or at your home. What was needed inside, placement of the room, drop cloths, food stations, and more, for any family member or friend that needed a safe haven, but could be infected, as to not risk your health or family.  With health officials saying that “We’re past the point of containment,” and strategizing on how to mitigate the damage, with claims that they expect that we will see at least “two months, probably, of difficulty” ahead, why not create a healthy quarantine zone/area?  Not for those infected, or at risk, but to keep the healthy people away from the public, considering many that have spread this virus had no clue they even had it when they did so.  The last place you want to be is where other people are, whether the virus has been reported in your city, town or village, or not, because by the time it is reported, it is too late to preemptively avoid them if no one knows they are sick.  Officials have given an estimated time frame of two months, so preparing for at least three, for those that aren’t already, is at least a step in the right direction.  For those already prepared with enough food, whether freeze dried, canned or just a great stock of it in your freezer and fridge, then only minor adjustments or preparations are needed.  Perhaps a QUARANTINE sign to keep people away from your home. Someone sees that, they aren’t going to think “healthy quarantine zone,” they are going to stay as far away as possible thinking someone could be infected. Maybe a pandemic prepping book, just to make sure you didn’t forget something really important.  For those that could not lock your doors right now, and be able to survive for three months with just what is in the home, well finding what you need may be difficult, depending on where you live.

That’s how Anne Frank died. She didn’t die in a concentration camp. She died of typhus.”  What kind of person misrepresents how Anne Frank died in order to try to score a political point against Trump and Israel? The far-left ‘Jewish Voice for Peace’ student activist type.  Rebbecca (Becca Lewis), a George Washington University Senior and “Jewish Voice for Peace” activist, appeared in a Now This video. Now This produces viral left-wing social media content, generating hundreds of thousand of views.  Now This produced a video of college students slamming Trump’s administrative order that sought to protect Jewish students on campus, as well as Trump’s immigration policies.  Lewis was one of the students interviewed. In a move that is typical for Jewish Voice for Peace, Lewis used her Jewish identity to provide cover to the other students in the video who were slamming Trump and Israel. The ploy is “Jew Washing,” where leftist Jews serve the role of human shield against accusations of anti-Semitism.  In doing so, Lewis brought Anne Frank into the discussion. It was totally gratuitous — Anne Frank has nothing to do with the current controversy. But Lewis didn’t stop there, she distorted Anne Frank’s death in order to compare Frank to health problems among parents and children detained for illegal entry at the U.S. border. AOC and others refer to the detention centers as “concentration camps” in order to invoke Holocaust imagery.  Lewis said that Anne Frank “didn’t die in a concentration camp. She died of typhus.” [Note: the captioning in the video says Frank didn’t die “from” a concentration camp, but the audio shows Lewis said Frank didn’t die “in” a concentration camp.]  “Our collective trauma from the Holocaust and just thousands of years of being persecuted has been weaponized against us to the point where now we have to have Israel. We have to live there. You have to support Israel because what’s going to happen if there is another Holocaust. What’s gonna happen? Well, we’re seeing what’s happening. We’re seeing people die at the border from lack of medical care. That’s how Anne Frank died. She didn’t die in a concentration camp. She died of typhus.” [Full video transcript at bottom of post]  Lewis’ statements wildly mischaracterized Frank’s death. Anne Frank did die in a concentration camp and whether her death in the concentration camp was from disease or otherwise is secondary. She was killed because she was Jewish, and her death has nothing to do with and is not similar to health problems with those illegally crossing the U.S. border.  Holocaust denial regarding Anne Frank is common among neo-Nazis, who try to discredit the Diary of Anne Frank as ‘Jewish Propaganda.’  Now This issued a retraction and deleted the original video.  In its place, Now This issued a “corrected” version eliminating the clip above in which Lewis made the comments, claiming Lewis “misspoke.”  CORRECTION: We have removed a segment of this video in which the speaker misspoke regarding Anne Frank’s death These Jewish and Palestinian students are speaking out against Trump for equating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism in his Judaism executive order pic.twitter.com/k6YGsp56h4 — NowThis (@nowthisnews) January 17, 2020  Lewis’ distortion of Jewish history is typical for Jewish Voice for Peace, a non-Jewish anti-Zionist group responsible for spreading the blood libel that Israel and American Jews are responsible for domestic police shootings of black, and which regularly hijacks Jewish holidays to use against Israel. Here is just a sample of Legal Insurrection’s prior coverage of Jewish Voice for Peace:  Lewis, whose twitter account appears to have been taken down, responded in a series of Tweets to the criticism of her statement about Anne Frank:  The point I was making is that she died of typhus BECAUSE she was in a concentration camp. I meant to say she didnt die in a gas chamber — the way many people think was the only way jews were killed. the mass extermination of jews was not only because of death camps. We often forget those who were told to dig their own graves before being shot and buried in them. systematic killing takes many forms outside of the way that many non jewish americans think. i was making the point that she died from a system which existed to kill jews. She died a preventable death that was not prevented because the system allowed it. I understand that it is a drastic comparison to compare anne franks death from a preventable disease (that was not prevented because the system allowed it) to a child who died of the flu in camp at the border (which was not prevented because the system allowed it). I think its important to not conceive the holocaust as something so atrocious that it can NEVER happen again. That is why we say never again — because it showed us how cruel man can be, & can be again, and thus we must ensure that it never happens again — to anyone.  Sorry, this doesn’t cut it. There was no reason to drag Anne Frank into this discussion. And having dragged her in, there was no reason to distort her death for your political purposes.  This is just another example of someone infused with anti-Israel and anti-Trump derangement who will say anything no matter how unhinged.   ——————–  Full transcript of the original NowThis video:  Becca Lewis, Senior George Washington University That man has no right to define what being Jewish is. He is the least qualified person on the planet what is and what isn’t being Jewish. Narrorator: Jewish & Palestinian students spoke out about Trump’s executive order that expands race & nationality protections to Judaism. Mohamed Elsherbiny: Freshman, American University This executive order has nothing to do with safety of Jewish allies. It is solely meant to repress people who champion Palestinian human rights. Narrorator: The order also expands the definition of anti-Semitism to include certain criticism of the Israeli gov’t, which has occupied Palestine for decades, in violation of international law. Lewis: I am Jewish, it is because I am Jewish that I fight for the rights and liberty of all people, and I do not associate my Judaism with a nation-state. It’s a dangerous, dangerous precedent. My only question is: What comes next? If we allow this to happen what more will we allow to happen? How far can this go? Narrator: The Trump admin has begun investigating selecti universities for pro-Palestine advocacy. Student activists say the order ‘falsely equates anti-Zionsim with anti-Semitism’ It is solely based in the system of white nationalism and white supremacy that we have in America especially for political gain to weaponize the Jewish identity against Palestinians. Elshebiny: The Palestinian and Jewish people have a large amount of political diversity and political thought and to generalize all Jewish people into this ‘nationality’ or this political opinion is absolutely ridiculous and totally unfair. Gabriela Rosner, a Senior at George Washington University When I went to high school and I saw –– what I saw as my Jewish identity was this deep social justice tradition rooted in solidarity and collective liberation –– suddenly be applies to this state that I felt had no representation of me whatsoever. Lewis: The most troubling thing about this executive order to me is that it is a veiled way to silence valid criticisms of a nation-state. It is a veiled way to silence Palestinian voices, to silence and pretty much dissolve the BDS movement Narrator: BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) is a nonviolent campaign to put economic pressure on Israel. It is modeled after the boycott campaign targeting South Africa’s apartheid regime in the 1980s. Donald Trump: My administration will never tolerate the suppression, persecution, or silencing of the Jewish people. We have also taken a firm stand against the so-called divestment and sanctions movement, or BDS, you know that very well. We forcefully condemn this anti-Semitic campaign against the State of Israel and its citizens. Narrator: Trump’s order might jeopardize funding at schools where students engage in the BDS movement and could pressure schools to ban the movement Soundbite of protest: We protest. Boycott, sanctions and divest. Elsheby: [BDS] comes from the history of South African apartheid. And a big thing, too, is that it kind of goes, like, one step at a time and gets bigger. So boycott is individual, where, like you boycott settler companies and companies that actually give money to human rights violations. And from there you go into divestment –– and that idea is that universities, and churches and things of that nature should divest from Israel to put pressure to have human rights arbiters and people of that nature. And lastly, sanctions is based around South Africa. Where the whole idea is to get governments to pull out. Narrorator: BDS demands that Israel and its occupation, remove the separation wall, allow Arab citizens full equality, and recognize the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes. Lewis: It is a way to try to institutionalize and then dissolve voices in groups like Jewish Voice for Peace and Students for Justice in Palestine. It’s a way to try and financially punish universities who receive Pell Grants and try to institutionalize this definition of antisemitism and this definition of what it means to be Jewish. That does not protect Jewish students, if you want to protect Jewish students give us more kosher options on campus, give us a shut on campus, give us days off for our religious holidays, do things that improve our day-to-day lives. Narrator: Trump has made sweeping policy changes toward Israel since taking office. Allen: he recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. He recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel. He reversed the decision that these settlements are illegal. And right now, as we’re seeing, he wants to silence Palestinian Americans on campus. Lewis: Our collective trauma from the Holocaust and just thousands of years of being persecuted has been weaponized against us to the point where now we have to have Israel. We have to live there. You have to support Israel because what’s going to happen if there is another Holocaust. What’s gonna happen? Well, we’re seeing what’s happening. We’re seeing people die at the border from lack of medical care. That’s how Anne Frank died. She didn’t die in a concentration camp. She died of typhus. Narrorator: Trump’s order came days after he used anti-Semitic tropes at an Israeli American summit. Sound bite from Trump at IAC: You have people that are Jewish people, that are great people –– that don’t love Israel enough and you know that. You’re brutal killers –– not nice people at all –– but you have to vote for me. You have no choice. Allen: The only space where I have felt that I can explore my faith and my –– you know, in a way that I can explore my faith and my activism and grow as, like a human being is being threatened to be taken away. And just the fact that there are literal white nationalists in the White House. There was a pogrom in New Jersey last week –– Donald Trump gave his most anti-Semitic speech in his entire presidency, and yet, he is being called a champion of Jewish rights. He has no right to define what being Jewish is. He is the least qualified person in the planet to be defining what is and what isn’t being Jewish. Narrator: Trump has previously questioned the loyalty of Jews who vote Democrat. Sound bite from trump August 20, 2019 I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty. Rosner: If this executive order is about making Jewish college students feel safer it has done the exact opposite to me. And it actually has the real intended purposes of stifling any and all solidarity with the Palestinian people.

There are no party lines that stop corruption, so I will never let party politics distract me from protecting public trust and making sure my office is transparent and that we are holding those who profit from corruption accountable to the rule of law.  Also on Friday, McMurray described himself as a progressive, which to him meant “what we did before isn’t good enough.”  “America is a work in progress. We must do better tomorrow than we did today. I don’t want to make America ‘great again,’ that’s regressive. Forward. Better. Inch by inch, upon the sacrifices of each generation,” he tweeted.

HOUSTON — Stimulus checks are hitting many bank accounts, but some citizens might not be getting a check.  “This is one of the major loopholes in the stimulus bill, which basically holds makes possibly for mixed status families to be left out,” said Kate Vickery, executive director for the Houston Immigration Legal Services Collaborative.  We’re talking about the U.S. citizens who file a joint tax return with a spouse that does not have a social security number. That’s because under the rules, payments can only be made to people with social security numbers and can’t be made to people with individual tax identification numbers otherwise known as ITIN. And that prevents these couples from receiving $2,400 of federal aid.  “There is no real reason to leave these families out. These are tax payers regardless or not if they have legal status. People with ITIN's pay federal income tax. Even if they are not a U.S. citizen,” Vickery said.  According to local immigrant activists, this impacts a lot of families in the Houston area.  “Those mixed status families, we have a lot in the greater Houston region about 100,000 U.S. citizens married to non-citizens,” Vickery said.  Some cities and states have decided to set up funds to help these mixed status and immigrant families. Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis is proposing to help all families in need despite their immigrant status. They will be discussing this at the next commissioners court meeting.   Coronavirus symptoms  The symptoms of coronavirus can be similar to the flu or a bad cold. Symptoms include a fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Some patients also have nausea, body aches, headaches and stomach issues. Losing your sense of taste and/or smell can also be an early warning sign.  Most healthy people will have mild symptoms. A study of more than 72,000 patients by the Centers for Disease Control in China showed 80 percent of the cases there were mild.  But infections can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death, according to the World Health Organization. Older people with underlying health conditions are most at risk for becoming seriously ill. However, U.S. experts are seeing a significant number of younger people being hospitalized, including some in ICU.

The Election Day development was the latest dizzying twist in a legal battle over the controversial rule that the Trump administration argues helps ensure those who are self-sufficient come to the country.  On Monday, U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman in Chicago struck down the rule and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services stopped applying it to pending applications. Government attorneys appealed, and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put a hold on the ruling the next day, allowing the restrictions to take effect again.  USCIS spokesman Matthew Bourke said Wednesday that the agency would immediately restart applying the rule to pending cases, but not “re-adjudicate any applications or petitions that were approved” in light of Monday’s decision.  Under the Trump administration rule, officials can deny permanent residency to legal immigrants over their use of food stamps, Medicaid or other public benefits. Green card applicants must show they wouldn’t be burdens to the country, or “public charges.”  Immigrant rights advocates deemed it a “wealth test,” while health experts warned of poorer health outcomes and rising costs as low-income migrants chose between necessary services and trying to stay in the country legally.  The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights and Cook County filed the lawsuit in Chicago and planned to submit arguments to the appeals court this month.  “It’s no surprise that Trump’s team is attempting to remove barriers that wouldn’t allow enforcement of his unlawful public charge definition, even after the courts clapped back at him earlier this week,” Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, whose office argued the case, said in a statement Wednesday. “I have confidence that the law will prevail here and immigrants across America will be treated fairly as human beings while this gets sorted in the appeal process.”  Democrat Joe Biden has promised to end the policy if he’s elected president.  The rule has already been heavily litigated.  In January, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a hold on the policy after lawsuits. However, enforcement was halted by a federal judge in New York because of the coronavirus pandemic. By September, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had reversed that hold and the rule took effect nationwide.   ___  Follow Sophia Tareen on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sophiatareen.

Italy's Communist Recipe for Disaster-Was it just the Chinese who brought the virus to Italy?  FrontPage Magazine ^ | Apr 9, 2020 | Giacomino Nicolazzo   Posted on by SJackson  Giacomino Nicolazzo is one of Italys most beloved writers. Born and raised in Central Pennsylvania, he lives in a small village in Lombardy where he writes his books.   Montecalvo, Lombardy, Italy.  As I sit here in my involuntary isolation, it was just reported that overnight 743 more people died and 5.249 new cases have been reported. This brings the total cases of infection to 69,176 and the body count to 6,820. We take relief in knowing that 8,326 people have recovered so far. (Numbers as of 3/24, 8:30pm in Italy.)  Most towns here in Italy, from the upper reaches of the Alps to the ancient shores of Sicilia and Sardenia, while not deserted, are closer to being ghost towns than the bustling centers of tourism, business and daily life they were just a few weeks ago.  Stores and shops have been shuttered. Restaurants and coffee shops no longer serve customers. Schools, universities, sporting arenas even our museums and theaters all closed. Even the Vatican City has closed its gates and armed patrols monitor the 20 foot tall walls that protect it!  Streets and roads are now empty for as far as the eye can see. Normally they would be filled with crazed Italian drivers in tiny cars and scooters (the ones that sound like demonic insects) darting here and there, reaching the limits of centrifugal force on our roundabouts. In the piazze of our towns and cities, there are now officially more pigeons than people.  Many of us know someone who has been infected and recovered. Some of us know someone who did not recover now they are dead. But everyone knows someone who has been affected by this microscopic monster in one way or another.  Sixty million of us are in lockdown. It is like a war zone here. We are being held prisoner in our own homes by an unseen enemy that sneaked in unnoticed by most of us. As you will read in just a few more minutes, there were those who knew something like this was coming . . or at least they should have.  So who is to blame? With all this craziness swirling like a whirlpool at our feet, I just had to find the blame answer. And so I have spent my free time (of which I have a lot in these days) digging and researching. I was literally shocked to discover how this has come to be.  I am not going to bore you with talk of Patient 0 who spread it to Patient 1 and how mathematics efficiently explains the rapid expansion of infection. No, I am going to tell you how (as I see it) the virus came to Italy.  It has everything to do with communists. Allow me to explain.  Beginning in about 2014, Matteo Renzi, the imbecile ex-mayor of Firenze (Florence) acting as the leader of the Partito Democratico (synonymous with the Italian Communist party), somehow managed to get himself elected as Italys Prime Minister. To give you a proper frame of reference, Matteo Renzi was so far left, he would make Barack Obama look like Barry Goldwater.  At the same time that Renzi was leading Italy into oblivion, strange things were happening in Italys economy. Banks were failing, but not closing. Retirement ages were being extended. For some reason the pension funds were dwindling or disappearing. The national sales tax we call IVA (Value Added Tax) rose from 18% to 20%, then to 21% and again to 22%.  And in the midst of all this financial chicanery, the Chinese began furiously buying up Italian real estate and businesses in the North.  Now, the reason I mention Renzi and the Chinese together is that strange things were also going on between the governments of Italy and China. A blind eye was being turned to the way the Chinese were buying businesses in the financial, telecommunication, industrial, and fashion sectors of Italys economy, all of which take place in Milano.  To be brief, China was getting away with purchases and acquisitions in violation of Italian law and EU Trade Agreements with the US and the UK - and no one in either of those countries (not Obama in the US or Cameron in the UK) said a thing in their countrys defense. As a matter of fact, much of it was hidden from the public in all three countries.  In 2014, China infused the Italian economy with 5 billion through purchases of companies costing less than 100 million each. By the time Renzi left office (in disgrace) in 2016, Chinese acquisitions had exceeded 52 billion. When the dust settled, China owned more than 300 companies, representing 27% of the major Italian corporations.  The Bank of China now owns five major banks in Italy, all of which had been secretly (and illegally) propped up by Renzi using pilfered pension funds! Soon after, the China Milano Equity Exchange was opened and much of Italys wealth was being funneled back to the Chinese mainland.  Chinese state entities own Italys major telecommunication corporation (Telecom) as well as its major utilities (ENI and ENEL). Upon entry into the telecommunication market, Huawei established a facility in Segrate, a suburb of Milano. It launched is first research center there and worked on the study of microwaves which has resulted in the possibly-dangerous technology we call 5G.  China also now owns controlling interest in Fiat-Chrysler, Prysmian and Terna. You will be surprised to know that when you put a set of Pirelli tires on your car, the profits are going to China. Yep, the Chinese colossus of ChemChina, a chemical industry titan, bought that company, too!  Last but not least is Ferretti yachts, the most prestigious yacht builder in Europe. Incredibly, it is no longer owned by the Ferretti family.  But the sector in which Chinese companies invested most was Italys profitable fashion industry. The Pinco Pallino, Miss Sixty, Sergio Tacchini, Roberta di Camerino and Mariella Burani brands have been acquired by 100%.  Designer Salvatore Ferragamo sold 16% and Caruso sold 35%. The most famous case is Krizia, purchased in 2014 by Shenzhen Marisfrolg Fashion Company, one of the leaders of high-priced, ready-to-wear fashions in Asia.  Throughout all of these purchases and acquisitions, Renzis government afforded the Chinese unrestricted and unfettered access to Italy and its financial markets, many coming through without customs inspections.  Quite literally, tens of thousands of Chinese came in through Milano (illegally) and went back out carrying money, technology, and corporate secrets.  Thousands more were allowed to enter and disappeared into shadows of Milano and other manufacturing cities of Lombardy, only to surface in illegal sewing shops, producing knock-off designer clothes and slapping Made In Italy labels on them. All with the tacit approval of the Renzi government.  It was not until there was a change in the governing party in Italy that the sweatshops and the illegal entry and departure of Chinese nationals was stopped. Matteo Salvini, representing the Lega Nord party, closed Italys ports to immigrants and systematically began disassembling the sweatshops and deporting those in Italy illegally.  But his rise to power was short-lived. Italy is a communist country. Socialism is in the national DNA. Ways were found to remove Salvini, after which the communist party, under the direction of Giuseppe Conte, reopened the ports. Immediately, thousands of unvetted, undocumented refugees from the Middle East and East Africa began pouring in again.  Access was again provided to the Chinese, under the old terms, and as a consequence thousands of Chinese, the majority from Wuhan, began arriving in Milano.  In December of last year, the first inklings of a coronavirus were noticed in Lombardy - in the Chinese neighborhoods. There is no doubt amongst senior medical officials that the virus was brought here from China.  By the end of January 2020 cases were being reported left and right. By mid-February the virus was beginning to seriously overload the Lombardy hospitals and medical clinics. They are now in a state of collapse.  The Far-Left politicians sold out and betrayed the Italian people with open border policies and social justice programs. One of the reasons the health care system collapsed so quickly is because the Renzi government (and now continued under the Conte government) redirected funds meant to sustain the medical system, to pay for the tens of thousands of immigrants brought in to Italy against the will of the Italian people.  If you remember the horrible earthquake that decimated the villages around Amatricia, in the mountains east of Rome in 2015, you would also remember how the world responded by sending millions of dollars to help those affected.  But there is a law in Italy that prevents private donations to charitable Italian organizations. All money and donations received must be turned over to a government agency, who in turn is to appropriate the funds as needed. But that agency is corrupt, just as are all the others.  Most of the money never reached a single victim in the mountains. The Renzi government redirected the vast majority of those funds to pay for the growing immigrant and refugee costs.  As the economy worsened under the burden of illegal immigration, compounded by gross government spending and incompetence, unemployment rose quickly especially among young people. The unemployment rate for men and women under age 35 is close to 40%.  So more money was diverted from the health care system and used to pay what is known here as guaranteed income. Whether you work or not you are paid here, especially if you belong to the PD! The government simply raises taxes on those who do work.  Let me give you a quick example of the height of insanity to which Italian taxation has risen. If you live in a building that has a balcony or balconies - and any of those balconies cast a shadow on the ground, you must pay a public shadow tax! I will say no more!  The point I am trying to make here is that not only did the Chinese bring the virus to Italy (and the rest of the world) it was far-Left politics and policies that facilitated it.  This should hopefully be a warning to Americans that while they work to rid themselves of the China Virus, they should just as vehemently endeavor to rid their government of any politician that circumvents the Constitution and ignores the laws of the land . . . plain and simple.

Relatives of both Carl Lenard, 62, and Stanton Johnson, 51, said the Richwood Correctional Center in Monroe, Louisiana, had at one point prevented them from wearing masks as the virus spread through the facility.  Lenard died early Saturday, according to his family.  He tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, though his cause of death is still undetermined.  His widow, Margarette Lenard, said she now has COVID-19 as well and several relatives have symptoms of the virus.  Johnson died Tuesday, according to his mother, Joyce Johnson, who also said that he had tested positive for COVID-19.  Both families believe the men contracted the virus working at Richwood, which has 45 detainees confirmed to have COVID-19.  There are 425 confirmed cases among detainees nationwide in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, a figure that has steadily risen in recent weeks.  No detainee deaths from COVID-19 have been reported at Richwood or other ICE facilities.  ICE has about 30,000 people detained and has tested 705 detainees, according to its publicly released figures.  The agency recently said it would receive 2,000 tests a month from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to ramp up testing of detainees.  LaSalle Corrections, the private prison company that operates Richwood, did not immediately respond to a question for comment about the guards. It also did not say how many guards at its immigration facilities are sick.  ICE referred questions about jail guard deaths to LaSalle.  “As an employer, if you employ a person, you have a mandate to protect them,” said Margarette Lenard, the widow of Carl Lenard. She added that she also blamed the national shortages of protective equipment and the re-use of masks and other gear.  A Richwood employee told the Associated Press in early April, guards were being told not to wear their own masks or gloves to avoid spreading panic among detainees, as many have pleaded for their release to avoid contracting the virus and more than 20 lawsuits have been filed against ICE. The employee was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.  Two days after the AP asked LaSalle Corrections about its personal protective equipment policy, the jail staff was told on April 8 they could start to wear masks and other equipment, according to the Richwood employee.  LaSalle executive Scott Sutterfield told the AP that protective equipment “is provided as necessary and employees can bring and wear masks.”  In the meantime, detainees were being brought in from other facilities in Texas and Louisiana to Richwood, the employee said.  Some of them were suspected of having the coronavirus.  One detainee, Salomon Diego Alonzo, was hospitalized shortly after being required to dial into an immigration court hearing where he struggled to speak, according to his attorney, Veronica Semino.  A guard standing near Alonzo told the judge during the hearing that the 26-year-old from Guatemala “does not have the lung capacity.”  Margarette Lenard confirmed her husband was concerned about being around detainees without the necessary protective equipment. She eventually obtained three cloth masks for him to wear.  Carl Lenard died unexpectedly in his home about 2 a.m. Saturday, she said.  He started having a fever Monday, six days before his death, she said. She gave him Tylenol and called a medical clinic, which had him come in Wednesday for a coronavirus test. His fever eventually broke, though he had a small cough.  He woke at about 1 a.m. Saturday and was talking to his wife and grandchildren. About 1:45, according to his widow, he started praying. Shortly afterward, he gave a single cough, then stopped breathing, she said.  A nurse practitioner, Margarette Lenard, tried to resuscitate him until the paramedics arrived but was unsuccessful.  Joyce Johnson, the mother of Stanton Johnson, said he died Tuesday. He initially started to have a fever and other symptoms last week, she said.  Both men had diabetes, their families said.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.  On Tuesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana and Southern Poverty Law Center called on ICE to improve conditions at Richwood.  “The ballooning number of positive COVID-19 cases at Richwood, and the reports of poor medical care that accompany this outbreak, demand your immediate attention to the conditions in that facility,” the lawyers said.

But the executive order would bar only those seeking permanent residency, not temporary workers.  Trump said he would be placing a 60-day pause on the issuance of green cards in an effort to limit competition for jobs in a U.S. economy wrecked by the coronavirus. The order would include 'certain exemptions,\" he said, but he declined to outlined them, noting the order was still being crafted.  'By pausing immigration we'll help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens, so important,\" Trump said at the White House. \"It would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labor flown in from abroad.'  An administration official familiar with the plans, however, said the order will apply to foreigners seeking employment-based green cards and relatives of green card holders who are not citizens. Americans wishing to bring immediate family will still be able to do so, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity before the plan was announced. About 1 million green cards were granted in the 2019 fiscal year, about half to spouses, children and parents of U.S. citizens.  By limiting his immigration measure to green cards, Trump was leaving untouched hundreds of thousands of foreign workers granted non-immigrant visas each year, including farm workers, health care workers and software programmers. The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, estimated that some 110,000 green cards could be delayed during a two-month pause. Trump said he would consider extending the restrictions, depending on economic conditions at the time.  Trump has long advocated restrictions on both legal and illegal immigration and has raised concerns for years about foreigners competing with American citizens for jobs.  But he denied he was using the virus to make good on a longstanding campaign promise during an election year. 'No, I'm not doing that all,\" he said. The president has also used the crisis to push other stalled priorities, from tax reform to dramatic border restrictions.  Trump has often pivoted to his signature issue of immigration when he's under criticism. It's one he believes helped him win the 2016 election and one that continues to animate his loyal base of supporters heading into what is expected to be a brutal reelection fight. It has also served as a useful tool for distracting from news he'd prefer removed from the headlines.  Much of the immigration system has already ground to a halt because of the pandemic. Almost all visa processing by the State Department has been suspended for weeks. Travel to the U.S. has been restricted from much of the globe. And Trump has used the virus to effectively end asylum at U.S. borders, including turning away children who arrive by themselves and putting a hold on refugee resettlement \" something Congress, the courts and international law hadn't previously allowed.  Criticism of Trump's announcement was swift, especially his timing during the pandemic. Ali Noorani, president of the National Immigration Forum, noted that thousands of foreign-born health care workers are currently treating people with COVID-19 and working in critical sectors of the economy.  Andrea Flores of the American Civil Liberties Union said Trump seemed \"more interested in fanning anti-immigrant flames than in saving lives.'  But Jessica Vaughn, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors lower rates of immigration, said before the announcement that eliminating millions of work permits and visas would 'instantaneously create' new jobs for Americans and other legal workers \" even though most businesses are shuttered because of social distancing dictates and stay-at-home orders.  Indeed, Carl Shusterman, who has practiced immigration law since the 1970s, said a 60-day pause would have little impact because the government effectively stopped processing green cards in March.  'The embassies are not open anyway, so this is like nothing new,' said Shusterman. 'This announcement doesn't really change anything unless the embassies were to open up next week or in the next 60 days.'  Trump first announced his intentions in a vague tweet Monday night. Across the country, those who could be impacted waited in suspense through the day. Chicago immigration attorney Fiona McEntee said she had been inundated with calls, emails and social media messages, including from company executives hoping to expand their business in the U.S., a person applying for a fiance visa and wondering about their wedding plans, artists seeking 'extraordinary ability' visas and foreign students.  'It has created absolute panic,' said McEntee. 'These are people's lives. ... It is irresponsible and cruel to put out something like that without any consideration.'  As is often the case, Trump's tweet also caught many across the administration off-guard.  Trump has already used the crisis to take dramatic steps to limit immigration. Last month, the administration effectively ended asylum, relying on a rarely used 1944 law aimed at preventing the spread of communicable disease. U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada have also been closed to tourism and recreational travel. Commercial traffic and a wide range of 'essential' workers are still allowed to travel freely.  The U.S. is now reporting more COVID-19 cases than any other country in the world, with almost 800,000 Americans infected, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. More than 42,000 have died.  Trump had been expected to use his authority to slash the number of foreign workers allowed to take seasonal jobs in the U.S. Before the outbreak, the administration had planned to increase the number of H-2B visas, angering people who favor more restrictive immigration policies, including some supporters of the president who view foreign workers willing to accept lower wages as unfair competition to American labor. The Department of Homeland Security later put that plan on hold.   ___  Spagat reported from San Diego.

At least two-thirds of states across the country are sharing the addresses of people who have tested positive for coronavirus with first responders, and at least 10 states are going so far as to share patients' identities as well.  The move is an effort by officials to arm police officers, firefighters, EMTS and other frontline workers with information that could help them avoid contracting the virus from one of the over 11 million people who have been infected in the U.S., according to reports by the Associated Press.  HAIR SALONS, BARBERSHIPS STAY OPEN DURING CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, EVEN WHEN LESS-THAN-LEGAL  However, those patients who took a test were assured that their private medical information would not be disclosed to anyone else, and activists are concerned that revealing the information would put minority groups at higher risk of being racially profiled, heightening tensions between law enforcement and black and Hispanic communities.  “The information could actually have a chilling effect that keeps those already distrustful of the government from taking the COVID-19 test and possibly accelerate the spread of the disease,” the Tennessee Black Caucus said in a statement.  State and local health departments keep track of who has received a test in their region and then provide the information to dispatch centers. The process is within the bounds of medical privacy laws, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  A review by the AP of information given to states shows that at least 35 states that share the addresses of those who tested positive.  At least 10 states -- Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Tennessee -- also share the names. Wisconsin did so briefly but stopped earlier this month.  When responding to a call for help, dispatchers are able to flag the information in a computer system regarding a positive case of COVID-19 and use it to forewarn responding officials to use precautions to prevent the spread of the disease. First responders are not allowed to refuse a call if it relates to a positive case of the virus and in some states, the information is deleted after a period of time.  Detractors of the practice also point to potential issues concerning immigration, if local officials are instructed to share the information they've obtained with federal agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security.

Marco Rubio made a bid for the White House. And four years from now, the Florida Republican might do it again.  “I ran for president once before, so clearly I’m not going to tell someone I’m not interested in running for president — I already ran for it once,” Rubio told CNN when asked if a 2024 bid was on his mind.  “But that’s a decision I’ll have to make at the appropriate time given what the world looks like, what my life looks like, my service here and what work remains to be done,” Rubio, who struggled to gain traction in the 2016 primary, said in the Capitol.  The 2020 election is now here — but in Washington, another election is always around the corner. And no matter what happens with President Donald Trump’s reelection bid, the GOP is bound to engage in an intense battle about its future direction: whether to align itself with Trump’s hardline politics catering to the party’s base or return to a more moderate, pro-business message to broaden the GOP’s tent.  If Trump wins reelection, Republicans expect jockeying over 2024 to take time to play out. But if Trump loses, the focus will quickly shift to a group of ambitious Republicans who are likely to be considered as potential White House hopefuls and will help chart the course for the post-Trump era of the Republican Party.  The names will include a host of current and former Trump administration officials, such as Vice President Mike Pence, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The debate will include GOP governors, such as Florida’s Ron DeSantis, Maryland’s Larry Hogan and South Dakota’s Kristi Noem.  And the spotlight will follow a suite of Republican senators who are likely to consider White House bids, including Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton.  Cotton, who is cruising to reelection this year and facing no Democratic candidate, has spent money on TV ads in key battleground states to help Trump, barnstormed for Republicans in tough races in Montana, Michigan and Georgia — and swung by early primary states Iowa and New Hampshire to appear with candidates.  Asked if those visits to early primary states were part of a campaign to prepare for 2024, Cotton contended he was trying to help Republicans in key House and Senate races. “I’m trying to hold on to the Senate and the House,” he told CNN, while ignoring a question about his potential interest in running for the White House.  But Cotton, who has long been viewed as a potential Cabinet secretary in Trump’s administration, could be on a shortlist for a new job if the President wins reelection, impacting the timing of any 2024 announcement.  Others are also likely to eye a presidential campaign.  Cruz, who has reemerged as an outspoken deficit hawk in the GOP this year, saying this summer he was a “hell no” as Republicans proposed spending another $1 trillion to prop up the economy, also is widely viewed as a likely contender for the White House, having lost to Trump in a vicious primary fight four years ago.  Cruz wouldn’t entertain questions about his 2024 ambitions.  “Let’s get through Election Day this year first,” he said outside the Capitol.  Indeed, how Tuesday shapes up for the GOP will have a major bearing on the debate within the party about whether and how to shift course from the scorched-earth nature of Trump’s presidency.  If Republicans lose up and down the ticket, there will be a loud chorus of calls to change course and begin to woo more moderate voters, including minorities, women and younger Americans — something the party tried to do with a top-to-bottom autopsy conducted by the Republican National Committee after Mitt Romney’s 2012 election loss to President Barack Obama.  Romney, now a Utah senator, told CNN last month that the GOP failed to follow that course and is now “in trouble” with key blocs of voters.  “I look at my race back in 2012 and there was a postmortem done about what we would do to get our party back in line with more of our voters,” Romney said. “And we haven’t taken that direction.”  No matter what happens on Tuesday, other Republicans want a more concerted focus on the debt and deficit, issues that have been largely ignored during the Trump years but became a focal point for huge fights between Republicans and Obama during his time in office.  “It just seemed to drop off the radar. … It’s like no one is paying attention to it anymore — and it’s worse than ever,” Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said of the debt.  Yet a number of Republicans argue that Trump has been successful in politics because he tapped into concerns from working class Americans about the GOP’s support for policies catering to big businesses, something they contend led to jobs being shipped overseas. These Republicans argue that no matter what happens on Tuesday, the GOP should continue to seize on that message.  Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri told CNN he would have “major concerns” about a return to a more expansive embrace of economic globalization, immigration and trade.  “I’m worried about any attempt that will try to go back to the days our policy was basically set by Wall Street,” Hawley said. “I think a lot of people in the Republican establishment want to go back to that kind of liberal globalism — and I think that would be a huge, huge mistake.”  Hawley, a 40-year-old former Missouri attorney general, also threw cold water on a possible 2024 run, telling CNN: “I’m not” considering a White House bid in four years.  Asked if a run were in the cards, Hawley said flatly: “It’s not.”  Some senators will face complicated decisions right away. Rubio, who faces reelection in 2022, may have to make a decision on running to keep his Senate seat — and then immediately running for president right after the midterm elections that year. Or, if he wants to set his sights exclusively on the White House, the senator may believe it makes sense to forgo a reelection run altogether.  “I guess I learned over the last six years, sometimes you really can’t cross a bridge if you don’t know which bridge you’re crossing,” Rubio said.  Other Republicans could face pressure to jump in as well. Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate’s lone Black Republican, who had a prime speaking role at the party’s national convention this summer, has been viewed as a possible White House contender.  But South Carolina’s junior Republican senator said “not at all” when asked if he was thinking about a 2024 run. “The best thing for me to plan for is reelection,” referring to his 2022 bid to keep his seat.  “I know that people start planning for a run for the White House around the eighth grade, or something like that, I hear,” Scott said. “I’m going to move to a ministry when this is all said and done. I want to keep my integrity.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 25, "positive": 33, "negative": 13, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 3, "joy": 4, "anger": 14, "surprise": 7, "fear": 4, "trust": 7}, "metadata": ["marco", "rubio", "republican", "cnn", "election", "donald", "gop", "trump", "texas", "tom", "ads", "visits", "campaign", "contended", "senate", "timing", "presidential", "barack", "utah", "fights", "obama", "seize", "embrace", "economic", "immigration", "convention", "ministry"]}, {"text": "PHOENIX (AP) \" In Joe Biden's pursuit of the Democratic presidential nomination, he's run repeatedly into a wall in the West, where Bernie Sanders' strength among Latinos propelled his campaign even as he struggled with other groups.  Tuesday's primaries in Arizona and Florida offer Biden a chance to show he can make up ground with Latinos, a crucial group of voters he'll need in his corner to defeat President Donald Trump.  Biden is playing catch-up when it comes to engaging Latino voters and is weighed down by anger over the high rate of deportations during the Obama administration, which left scars for many immigrants and their families.  'We need more. And we need commitments as we move into the general,' said Regina Romero, a Democrat who recently took office as Tucson's first Latina mayor. Biden can win over reluctant Latinos with a bold and progressive stance on immigration, she said.  'I hope that he doesn't eat up the lie that he has to be more conservative on the immigration issue,' said Romero, who hasn't endorsed Biden or Sanders since her favored candidate, Elizabeth Warren, dropped out. 'We shouldn't be afraid of an issue that is so important for Latino voters, water it down and not have policies that Latinos can get excited about.\"  Arizona and Florida are both likely to be battlegrounds in November. In Arizona, 1 in 3 residents is Latino; in Florida, it's 1 in 4.  Sanders' strength with Latinos helped him to an overwhelming victory in the Nevada caucuses and contributed to his Super Tuesday wins in California and Colorado on a night when Biden built a formidable lead in delegates.  But Biden's success is a recent phenomenon. His slow start amid a crowded Democratic field left him with a shoestring budget and virtually no campaign infrastructure beyond the early states, which limited his ability to reach out to Latinos on the ground or air Spanish-language television ads. That's changed now that his burst of success since South Carolina made him the overwhelming favorite for the nomination and helped his fundraising.  'He definitely needs to work it, and he needs to up his game and engage with Latino voters,' said Janet Murguía, president and CEO of UnidosUS, the Latino advocacy group formerly known as National Council of La Raza. Tuesday could make for 'a big reset' for Biden, she said.  Biden has had to answer for the big spike in deportations during Barack Obama's presidency, when Biden served as vice president.  Early in his administration, Obama aggressively increased efforts to deport immigrants living in the country illegally. He'd hoped to convince members of Congress and the public that he was serious about border security in order to secure a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would extend legal status to millions of people living in the U.S. without authorization. The reform bill never passed, but the deportations disrupted families, drove fear in immigrant communities and left deep wounds.  Any Democrat's immigration policies would be superior to Trump's, but that won't be enough to excite Latinos, said Tomás Robles, co-director of Living United for Change in Arizona, or LUCHA, a Latino organizing group that has endorsed Sanders.  'You cannot depend on people's hatred or fear of Trump to inspire them to turn out in droves for Vice President Biden,' Robles said. 'Bernie has worked hard to motivate Latinos as a base. But the entire establishment part has failed at doing the same.'  Lucha's other co-director, Alejandra Gomez, said Biden could make big strides by choosing a progressive running mate.  The Obama administration deported more than 3 million people during his eight-year tenure, especially in the early years before Obama gave up on Congress and changed course, using executive orders to extend temporary legal protections to young immigrants and their parents through programs known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA.  'We took far too long to get it right,' Biden said in an interview last month with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, for the first time characterizing the administration's actions as a misstep. The former vice president later added: 'I think it was a big mistake. Took too long to get it right.'  Biden and his allies focus on the later years of the Obama administration.  U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, who represents largely Latino areas of Phoenix and endorsed Biden this month, predicted that Latino voters will come around. But he said Biden could help himself by talking up his own progressive proposals, such as a $15 minimum wage and a public option for health insurance. He should also talk about the Obama health care law that extended coverage to millions of Americans, including a disproportionate number of Latinos, Gallego said.  While Arizona Latinos are frustrated with the Obama-era deportations, Gallego said, they also remember that the administration sued to block the state's anti-illegal immigration bill known as SB1070, sued Sheriff Joe Arpaio for racial profiling and enacted DACA.  'Even those voters who aren't supporting Vice President Biden right now, I think they still have positive feelings toward him and at the end of the day will be very supportive in the general,' Gallego said.  Biden's defenders also point to Sanders' work to help kill a 2007 immigration bill, which Sanders warned would drive down wages.  'No one's perfect, but let's not forget that he made a fatal mistake by doing that,' Gallego said.  Latinos in the West, where Sanders has done so well, are mainly of Mexican and Central American descent. It's a different story in Florida, where Cubans and Puerto Ricans predominate, making the state a potential bright spot for Biden. Sanders' self-identity as a democratic socialist and his recent defense of certain aspects of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro's regime are a liability with Cuban voters.  'Miami is a melting pot for people from all over,' said Jos� Javier Rodríguez, a Democratic state senator from Miami who was an early Biden supporter. 'Biden's appeal hits a cross-section in ways that Sen. Sanders does not.'  Biden's campaign is upping its Latino organizing in Arizona through its 'Todos con Biden' or 'Everyone with Biden' program, including Spanish-language phone banks and door-to-door outreach. In Florida, Biden's Spanish-language ads use a Cuban narrator in Miami, a Puerto Rican in Orlando and a Mexican in Fort Myers to reflect the backgrounds of Latinos in each area.  Biden will need that outreach in a matchup against Trump. In Arizona, the growth of Latinos combined with Trump's weaknesses in the suburbs have turned a solidly red state into a battleground. And for the president, there's virtually no path to reelection without winning Florida and its trove of electoral votes.  Sanders put to rest the old adage that Latinos don't vote, said Chuck Rocha, a senior strategist for Sanders.  The Latino vote, he said, 'is no longer the sleeping giant. It just needed a little attention and a little love and it will show up.'   ___  Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, 'Ground Game.'

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  Stop and reverse. Restore and expand.  Joe Biden is promising to take the country on a very different path from what it has seen over the past four years under President Donald Trump, on issues ranging from the coronavirus and health care to the environment, education and more.  The Democratic presidential nominee is promising to reverse Trump policy moves on things such as withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement and weakening protections against environmental pollution.  While Trump wants to kill the Affordable Care Act, Biden is proposing to expand “Obamacare” by adding a public option to cover more Americans.  Here's what we know about what a Biden presidency might look like.   ___  ECONOMY, TAXES AND THE DEBT  Biden argues that the economy cannot fully recover until COVID-19 is contained.  For the long-term recovery, the former vice president is pitching sweeping federal action to avoid an extended recession and to address long-standing wealth inequality that disproportionately affects nonwhite Americans.  He would cover the cost of some of his big ticket environmental and health insurance proposals by rolling back much of the 2017 GOP tax overhaul. He wants a corporate income tax rate of 28% — lower than before but higher than now — and broad income and payroll tax increases for individuals with more than $400,000 of annual taxable income. All that would generate an estimated $4 trillion or more over 10 years.  Biden also frames immigration as an economic matter. He wants to expand legal immigration slots and offer a citizenship path for about 11 million people who are in the country illegally but who, Biden notes, are already economic contributors as workers and consumers.  An analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that Biden’s campaign proposals would increase the national debt by about $5.6 trillion over 10 years.  The national debt now stands at more than $20 trillion.   ___   CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC  Biden draws some of his sharpest contrasts with Trump on the pandemic, arguing that the presidency and federal government exist for such crises. Unlike Trump, he doesn’t believe the leading role in the virus response should belong to state governors, with the federal government in support.  Biden endorses generous federal spending to help businesses and individuals, along with state and local governments, deal with the financial cliffs of the pandemic slowdown. He’s promised aggressive use of the Defense Production Act, the wartime law a president can use to direct manufacture of critical supplies. Trump has used that law on such things as ventilator production.  Biden promises to elevate the government’s scientists and physicians to communicate a consistent message to the public, and he would have the United States rejoin the World Health Organization.  He has promised to use his transition period before taking office to convene meetings with every governor and ask those leaders to impose what would be a nationwide mask mandate because the federal government doesn't have that power. Biden says he would go around holdouts by securing such rules from county and local officials — though enforcement of all such orders may be questionable.   ___   HEALTH CARE  The health care law known as “Obamacare” was a hallmark of the Obama administration, and Biden wants to build on that to provide coverage for all. He would create a “Medicare-like public option” to compete alongside private insurance markets for working-age Americans, while increasing premium subsidies that many people already use. Solid middle-class households would have access to subsidized health insurance.  Biden estimates his plan would cost about $750 billion over 10 years. That positions Biden between Trump, who wants to scrap the 2010 health law, and progressives who want a government-run system to replace private insurance altogether. Biden sees his approach as the next step toward universal coverage and one he could get through Congress.  The Supreme Court, which now has a solid conservative majority, is scheduled to hear a case challenging the law soon after Tuesday's election. If Biden wins, he would have to deal with the fallout from that eventual decision.  On prescription drugs, Biden supports legislation allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for government programs as well as private payers. He would prohibit drug companies from raising prices faster than inflation for people covered by Medicare and other federal programs. He would also limit the initial prices for “specialty drugs” to treat serious illnesses, using what other countries pay as a yardstick.  Biden would put a limit on annual out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare enrollees, a change that Trump sought but was unable to get through Congress. Also similar to Trump, Biden would allow importation of prescription drugs, subject to safety checks.   ___   IMMIGRATION  Biden has called Trump’s actions on immigration an “unrelenting assault” on American values and says he would “undo the damage” while continuing to maintain border enforcement.  Biden says he would immediately reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which allowed people brought to the U.S. illegally as children to remain as legal residents, and end the restrictions on asylum imposed by Trump.  He also said he would end the Trump administration’s “public charge rule,” which would deny visas or permanent residency to people who use public services such as Medicaid, food stamps or housing vouchers. Biden would support a 100-day freeze on all deportations while his administration studied ways to roll back Trump policies. But Biden would eventually restore an Obama-era policy of prioritizing the removal of immigrants who have come to the U.S. illegally and who have been convicted of crimes or pose a national security threat, as opposed to all immigrants who have come to the country illegally — Trump's approach. Biden has said he would halt all funding for construction of new walls along the U.S.-Mexico border.   ___  FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY  Biden supports a strategy of fighting extremist militants abroad with U.S. special forces and airstrikes instead of planeloads of U.S. troops. He wants to see the U.S. close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. He has backed some U.S. military interventions, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq that he now says was a mistake, but he leans toward diplomacy and trying to achieve solutions through alliances and global institutions.  He is a strong supporter of NATO. He warns that Moscow is chipping away at the foundation of Western democracy by trying to weaken NATO, divide the European Union and undermine the U.S. electoral system. He also alleges that Russia is using Western financial institutions to launder billions of dollars to use to influence politicians.  Biden calls for increasing the Navy’s presence in the Asia-Pacific and strengthening alliances with Japan, South Korea, Australia and Indonesia. He joins Trump in wanting to end the wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan, but thinks the U.S. should keep a small force in place to counter terrorism.  He says Trump’s decisions to exit bilateral and international treaties such as the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord have led other nations to doubt Washington’s word. Biden wants to invite all democratic nations to a summit to discuss how to fight corruption, thwart authoritarianism and support human rights.  Biden, who claims “ironclad” support for Israel, wants to curb annexation and has backed a two-state solution in the long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. He says he would keep the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem after Trump moved it from Tel Aviv.  Biden criticizes Trump’s diplomacy with Kim Jong Un, saying Trump's one-on-one diplomacy gave legitimacy to the North Korea leader and has not convinced Kim that he should give up his nuclear weapons.   ___   ENVIRONMENT  Biden is proposing a $2 trillion push to slow global warming by throttling back the burning of fossil fuels, aiming to make the nation’s power plants, vehicles, mass transport systems and buildings more fuel efficient and less dependent on oil, gas and coal.  Biden says his administration would ban new permits for oil and gas production on federal lands, although he says he does not support a fracking ban.  Biden’s public health and environment platform also calls for reversing the Trump administration’s slowdown of enforcement against polluters, which in several categories has fallen to the lowest point in decades. That would include establishing a climate and environmental justice division within the Justice Department.  Biden emphasizes environmental justice, which is about addressing the disproportionate harm to lower-income and minority communities from corporate polluters. Biden says he would support climate lawsuits targeting fossil fuel-related industries.  He said he would reverse Trump's plan to exit the Paris climate accord.   ___   EDUCATION  Education is a family affair for Biden. His wife, Jill, has taught in high school and community college, and she delivered her speech to the Democratic National Convention this year from her old classroom.  Biden has proposed tripling the federal Title I program for low-income public schools, with a requirement that schools provide competitive pay and benefits to teachers. He wants to ban federal money for for-profit charter schools and to provide new dollars to public charters only if they show they can serve needy students. He opposes voucher programs, where public money is used to pay for private school education.  He has pledged to restore Obama-era policies that were rolled back by the Trump administration, including rules on campus sexual misconduct and a policy that aimed to cut federal money to for-profit colleges that left students with heavy debt and unable to find jobs to pay it back.  Biden supports legislation to make two years of community college free and to make public colleges free for families with incomes below $125,000. His proposed student loan overhaul would not require repayment for people who make less than $25,000 a year, and would limit payments to 5% of discretionary income for others.  He is proposing a $70 billion increase in funding for historically Black colleges and universities, and other schools that serve underrepresented students.   ___   ABORTION  Biden supports abortion rights and has said he would nominate federal judges who would uphold Roe v. Wade.  He would rescind Trump’s family planning rule, which has prompted many clinics to leave the federal Title X program that provides birth control and basic medical care for low-income women.  In a switch from his previous stance, Biden now says he supports “repeal” of the Hyde Amendment, opening the way for federal programs such as Medicaid to pay for abortions.   ___   SOCIAL SECURITY  Biden has a Social Security plan that would expand benefits, raise taxes for upper-income people, and add some years of solvency.  He would revamp Social Security’s annual cost-of-living adjustment by linking it to an inflation index that more closely reflects changes in costs for older people, particularly health care. That’s been a priority for advocates. He would also increase minimum benefits for lower-income retirees, addressing financial hardship among the elderly.  Biden would raise Social Security taxes by applying the payroll tax to earnings above $400,000 a year. The 12.4% tax, equally distributed among employees and employers, currently only applies to the first $137,700 of a person’s earnings. The tax increase would pay for Biden’s proposed benefit expansions and also extend the life of program’s trust fund by five years, to 2040, according to the nonpartisan Urban Institute.   ___   GUNS  Biden led efforts as a senator to establish the background check system now in use when people buy guns from a federal licensed dealer. He also helped pass a 10-year ban on a group of semi-automatic guns, or “assault weapons,” during the Clinton presidency.  Biden has promised to seek another ban on the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Owners would have to register existing assault weapons with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. He would also support a program to purchase assault weapons.  Biden supports legislation restricting the number of firearms an individual may purchase per month to one and would require background checks for all guns sales with limited exceptions, such as gifts between family members.  Biden would also support legislation to prohibit all online sales of firearms, ammunition, kits, and gun parts.   ___   VETERANS  Biden says he would work with Congress to improve health services for women, the military’s fastest-growing subgroup, such as by placing at least one full-time women’s primary care physician at each Department of Veterans Affairs' medical center.  He promises to provide $300 million to better understand the impact of traumatic brain injury and toxic exposures, hire more VA staff to cut down office wait times for vets at risk of suicide to zero as well as continue the efforts of the Obama-Biden administration to stem homelessness.   __   TRADE  Like Trump, Biden accuses China of violating international trade rules, subsidizing its companies and stealing U.S. intellectual property. But he doesn’t think Trump’s tariffs have worked and wants to join with U.S. allies to form a bulwark against Beijing.  Biden has joined a growing bipartisan embrace of “fair trade” abroad — a twist on decades of “free trade” talk as Republican and Democratic administrations alike expanded international trade. Biden wants to juice U.S. manufacturing by directing $400 billion of federal government purchases to domestic companies (part of that for buying pandemic supplies) over a four-year term.  He wants $300 billion in new support for U.S. technology firms’ research and development. Biden says the new domestic spending must come before he enters into any new international trade deals.  He pledges tough negotiations with China, the world’s other economic superpower, on trade and intellectual property matters. China, like the U.S., is not yet a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the multilateral trade agreement that Biden advocated for when he was vice president. As a senator, Biden voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement that the Trump administration renegotiated. The replacement went into effect on July 1.   ___  Associated Press Writers Kevin Freking, Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Ben Fox, Deb Riechmann, Collin Binkley and Hope Yen contributed to this report.

His statement drew a spontaneous burst of applause from hundreds who packed in the Basilica Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington on the eve of the march, which marks the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v Wade ruling legalizing abortion in the United States.  The archbishop of Kansas City, Kansas, and chairman of the USCCB’s committee on pro-life activities, Naumann said the bishops approved a document in November that provides “guidance to Catholics as they exercise their responsibility as voters.”  And while Catholics must consider “many important societal issues with great moral significance,” such as immigration reform, care for refugees and the poor, health care, religious liberty, and the “care for creation,\" the bishops “affirmed that the protection of the unborn remains the preeminent priority,” Naumann said, to a burst of applause.  Watch Archbishop Naumann's full homily:  The bishops’ document cited Pope St. John Paul II’s “landmark and prophetic” encyclical The Gospel of Life, issued 25 years ago this March 25, the feast of the Annunciation, he said.  The sainted pontiff noted that the “vast array of threats to human life” included poverty, the arms trade, drugs, and the promotion of “certain forms of sexual activity,” but “spoke clearly that special attention should be given to the issues of abortion and euthanasia,” Naumann observed.  St. John Paul stated three reasons why the protection of the unborn must be a priority.  First, current laws “exalt abortion as a positive good and a right”; second, abortion “attacks human life at the time of its greatest frailty,” and finally, abortion’s “personal and societal consequences are more serious because they are carried out in the very heart of and with the complicity of the family,” which “by its very nature is called to be the sanctuary of life.”  Moreover, the “sheer number” of those killed by abortion “elevates its importance compared to other threats to life,” Naumann said.  Since 1973, 61 million unborn children have been killed by abortion and each had a father and mother “who’ve been starved by the death of their child.”  Naumann also related that when he and bishops from Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska met with Pope Francis one week ago for their ad limina visit, “I told him that we received some criticism, even being accused of insulting the pope.”  The pope “appeared stunned,” and asked why.  “And I said because we called the protection of the unborn a ‘preeminent priority,’ and his immediate response was, ‘It is a preeminent priority’. Pope Francis said if we do not defend life, no other rights matter,” Naumann said.  “God and 14 other bishops are my witnesses that Pope Francis was passionate in the support of the Church’s pro-life efforts. My friends, the successor of Peter has our backs,” added the archbishop, to applause.  The Holy Father was also “aware of this March for Life” and “delighted” at the expected large numbers, and “ordered” Naumann to “please tell the pilgrims at the March for Life and the entire pro-life community, the pope is with you, he is praying for you, he supports you, he encourages you to persevere.”  Pope Francis has stoked confusion in past on the priority of the pro-life issue in voting, contradicting previous popes by seeming to place abortion on a level with prudential issues such as immigration.  Throughout his pontificate, he has prioritized lobbying world leaders on climate change, immigration, and other issues while failing to intervene on non-negotiable moral issues such as abortion and same-sex “marriage.”  According to Naumann, Pope Francis was “thrilled” with the USCCB initiative to mark the 25th anniversary of the Gospel of Life: “Walking with Moms In Need: A year of Service,” Naumann said.  This initiative will encourage every Catholic parish in the United States, which number well over 17,000, to consider what “practical steps” they can take to help mothers facing difficult pregnancies, Naumann said.  Many women who choose abortion are “young, poor and unmarried, and “moms in need are best reached at the local level,” he said.  “Pope Francis reminds us parish called to be islands of mercy in the midst of the sea of indifference.”  He noted that Pope John Paul in the Gospel of Life “cautioned us about he termed ‘an extremely serious and mortal danger that of confusion between good and evil, precisely in relation to the fundamental right to life.”  The saint wrote that “this moral confusion results in part from a distorted notion of freedom, of freedom that is untethered from truth,” Naumann said.  “Freedom separated from truth in the end creates a tyrant state that allows and even encourages the disposal of life when it is weakest.”  This is evident in the United States, where, since the 47 years since Roe v Wade, “the killing of one’s child is exalted as heroic and brave,” and Americans live in an “ethically topsy-turvy twilight zone” in which abortion is “now hailed as the cornerstone of human rights,” Nauman said.  But “in these early days of 2020 there are signs of hope,” he added.  “Despite a biased secular media, decades persistent pro-life educational efforts have resulted in our nation’s youth being more pro-life than their parents,” he said, to sustained applause.

The move leaves the remaining coalition partners ruling in a minority.  Finance Minister Siv Jensen announced the resignation of her Progress Party on Monday, after a woman suspected of marrying two Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) jihadists in Syria was given assistance to return to Norway over the weekend. The Norwegian government aided the woman’s return out of concern for the welfare of her children, but Jensen’s party had vehemently opposed any repatriation for Islamist fighters or their spouses.  “I brought us into government, and now I’m bringing the party out,” Jensen told reporters on Monday, adding that her Conservative, Liberal, and Christian Democratic coalition partners had forced her to make “too many compromises” to her platform of tax cuts and immigration restrictions.  Also on rt.com King of Jordan says ISIS on the rise, warns thousands of fighters moved to Libya from Syria’s Idlib, spelling more trouble for EU  Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg said that she will remain in office as head of a minority coalition, and will fill the seven cabinet posts left vacant after the Progress Party’s departure. Early elections are not allowed by Norway’s constitution, and voters will decide the next government in September 2021.  The alleged IS bride is of Pakistani origin, and left Norway for Syria in 2013. She is believed to have married a Norwegian-Chilean IS fighter that year. The fighter, Bastian Vasquez, threatened the Norwegian government in a video he posted to YouTube. Another IS propaganda video shows Vasquez admitting to multiple murders and blowing up a police station, supposedly with Iraqi soldiers inside.  The woman remarried after Vasquez’s death in 2015. She has been held in a refugee camp in northern Syria since last March, along with her five-year-old son and three-year-old daughter. The eldest child has a long-term illness, believed to be cystic fibrosis.  The decision to bring the woman and her children back to Norway was made last week on “humanitarian grounds,” Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soreide said.  Progress Party members greeted that announcement with derision. “The government negotiated with a terrorist,” lawmaker Roy Steffensen tweeted last week. “Terrorists won.”  Regjeringen forhandlet med en terrorist. Terroristen vant. — Roy Steffensen (@roysteffensen) January 14, 2020  Norway is not the only country to welcome back its IS spouses. Former Irish soldier Lisa Smith, who married an IS jihadist and moved to Syria in 2015, was returned to Dublin last month from Istanbul, where she had been living since her capture by Turkish forces. Smith was arrested upon arrival.  Other European countries have been more reluctant to repatriate jihadists and their families – to the consternation of American and Turkish authorities, who are holding many of the captured fighters in Middle-Eastern prison camps.  US President Donald Trump has repeatedly chastised European leaders for not taking back the captured jihadis. “Would you like some nice ISIS fighters?” he asked at a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron last month. \"I can give them to you. You can take everyone you want.”  The Norwegian woman was arrested upon her return, and faces up to six years in prison if found guilty of participating in a terrorist organization.

The chief political anchor and former White House correspondent sat in his old press seat. He attended as part of his show, “Special Report with Bret Baier,” which has often been interrupted by the briefings.  Baier got numerous questions in during the briefing and didn’t stop there. Upon its conclusion and after candid words with Trump, Baier immediately turned around to face the camera and transitioned back to a host – and people couldn’t stop talking about it.  “The President of the United States wrapping up his press briefing, welcome to Special Report,” Baier said as he stood up from his old seat in the front row of the press room. “I’m Bret Baier.”  “We’re doing it tonight from the White House briefing room, a little bit different tonight.

He also asked about North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, who was reported to be “in grave danger” by CNN on Monday evening.

Before the debate, the commission in charge of the event made the decision that the candidates would have two minutes uninterrupted for each topic and their opponent's mic would be muted while they were speaking. The result was a success. The candidates let each other speak without interruption for most of the night. NBC anchor Kristen Welker was the debate moderator.Follow along below to read more about what happened. 10:50 p.m. ETPresident Donald Trump used his final remarks to say the country is rebuilding itself from the pandemic, reflecting back at a booming economy.He also launched a warning, saying if Joe Biden is elected, there will be a “depression — the likes of which you’ve never seen. Your 401(k)s will go to hell.”Responding to the same question about what would be said in his inaugural address if elected, Biden said he would represent the entire country, whether they voted for or against him. He also said he’d work to create millions of jobs with clean energy and said moral issues, such as decency and respect, are on the ballot.10:45 p.m. ETWelker questioned the candidates on how they could combat climate change while also supporting job growth.Trump opened by expressing his desire for the U.S. to have the world’s cleanest air and water and have the lowest carbon emissions. He said he removed the country from the Paris Climate Accord in 2017 because “I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies.”Biden said he would plan to have 50,000 car-charging stations along highways in the U.S. so “we can own the electric car market.” He said his plans on helping the environment would create millions of jobs while also protecting people's health.Trump pushed back on Biden’s plan to renovate millions of buildings and homes and make them more energy efficient by saying “they want to knock down buildings” and build new ones with “tiny” windows.Under his administration, Trump said, the U.S. is “energy independent for the first time.” He brought up some of his common talking points, such as how windmills are “extremely expensive” and kill birds. In closing out the topic, Welker asked about families who live near, for example, refineries or steel mills. She referenced that many of them are minorities.Trump argued that people who live near those types of facilities are secure with good-paying jobs and that the U.S. oil industry is thriving because of policies he says he imposed to limit production overseas.Biden said those front-line communities care more about being safe than what you’re paying them and that the country needs to transition out of the oil industry, a moment Trump pounced on as a big statement. Biden said oil needs to be replaced by renewable energy “over time.”After Trump pushed Biden on his stance on fracking, Biden firmly denied that he is against fracking. Biden said Trump continues to take a statement he made about banning fracking on federal land out of context. Biden said he would work on a plan to capture fracking emissions.10:30 p.m. ETIn talking about race, Trump said no one has done more for the Black community than he has — with the “possible exception” of President Abraham Lincoln.Trump later switched his remarks, saying not since Lincoln has anybody done what he’s done, citing his efforts in criminal justice, prison reform and long-term funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.Attacking one another’s record and defending their own, candidates discussed issues ranging from Black Lives Matter to criminal justice reform.Trump questioned why the Obama administration did not do more to pass criminal justice reform. Biden cited the administration's ties to the release of 38,000 federal prisons and clemency to over 1,000 people.Biden also stressed that no one should be going to jail if they have a drug problem, suggesting a fundamental overhaul of the criminal justice system.Trump continued to question why Biden didn’t carry out plans for change during his eight years as vice president.10:10 p.m. ETThe third topic transitioned to health care and the economy and how they impact American families.As Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans advanced Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court nomination Thursday, Welker questioned Trump on what his plan would be if the Affordable Care Act gets overturned when the Supreme Court hears the case in November.Trump touted the elimination of the ACA’s individual mandate during his administration and vowed that those with preexisting conditions would be covered under a plan that would take over for the ACA.Biden said his health care plan would allow for a public option and that he supports private insurance, something he said made him different than his Democratic challengers.Trump said Biden is pushing for “socialized medicine” and that his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, is helping push for it. Welker then pivoted to jobless and poverty rates amid the pandemic. Trump said a relief bill has been stuck in the negotiation process because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want a deal.Biden said Democrats have tried to pass it but Republicans are saying they would not have the votes.The debate turned to immigration policies for both candidates. Welker asked Trump if the administration had a plan to find the parents of more than 500 kids who were separated from their parents at the border. Trump said the kids came over through coyotes, cartels and gangs. But, he said, people being held at the border were being taken care of \"very well.\"Biden countered and said the kids separated at the border came with parents.Welker questioned Biden on the Obama administration’s failure to pass immigration reform.Biden conceded they got it wrong. He said he will send a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people within his first 100 days in office. Trump mentioned Biden had eight years as vice president to make changes and that his own administration has made changes over the past four years. Trump and Biden went back and forth on the catch-and-release policy and what the purpose of it was under the Obama administration. Trump eliminated it.10:00 p.m. ETBoth candidates pointed to their opponents’ finances in talking about foreign threats.Trump claimed the Biden family received $3.5 million from the wife of a Moscow mayor.Biden responded that he hasn’t received a single penny from another nation.In a back-and-forth of who was profiting in foreign countries, Trump said Biden makes money from China, Ukraine or Russia. Biden claimed Trump was profiting from several foreign countries.Moderator Kristen Welker also asked about a recent report regarding a Trump bank account in China.Trump said he opened the account in 2013 and believed it was closed in 2015. He said he closed it before he even ran for president.The debate also moved into discussing North Korea, leading Trump to say we’re not in a war and they have a good relationship. Biden questioned that the U.S. must have had a good relationship with Adolf Hitler before he invaded the rest of Europe, adding “come on.”Trump said the previous administration left him a mess and put the U.S. in a dangerous position.9:30 p.m. ETThe debate began with the coronavirus pandemic on a day where the death tolls from the virus topped 222,000.Debate moderator Kristen Welker asked the candidates to be specific and describe how they would lead the country through the next stage of the pandemic.During his two-minute response — in which he harkened back to past models that estimated 2.2 million Americans could die from from COVID-19 and discussed his own diagnosis and recovery — Trump broke some news, saying a vaccine could be available in the U.S. and announced in a few weeks. After Biden retorted, saying he would institute national masking and reopening guidelines, Welker went back to Trump’s vaccine claim. Trump said he has the military prepared to distribute potentially 100 million vials of a vaccine, which he says is close to being completed by companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer and others. The candidates, remaining respectful of each other’s speaking time, went back and forth on the state of the virus in the country, which Trump, as he has throughout his recent campaign rallies, says is “rounding the corner.”Trump said the country is learning how to live with it and that “we have to recover. We can’t close up our nation.”Biden responded by saying the U.S. is not learning to live with it: “We’re dying with it.”Trump reiterated his desire to get schools around the country to reopen because, he says, the rate of transmission to teachers is low. “We’re not going to have a country,” Trump said. “This is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs, committing suicide.”Biden said he would develop national guidelines to assist in the safe reopening of schools and businesses.“We ought to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time,” Biden said.

(AP) - Connecticut officials are struggling to handle an overwhelming number of unemployment claims stemming from the coronavirus outbreak that has grown to more than 220,000 in roughly two weeks, Gov. Ned Lamont said Thursday.  The Democrat said his administration has been “throwing more and more people” at the huge task of processing claims, including hiring back retired state employees, to try and reduce a backlog, while at the same time trying to upgrade the state Department of Labor’s aging computer system to speed up process.  “This is going on around the country and it’s going on right here. And right now it’s a backlog of five or six weeks and it’s absolutely unacceptable,” Lamont said. “Give us a four or five days. We’re working on an end-around, working out with a fix that would allow us to have an expedited process.”  State Department of Labor officials said earlier Thursday that the agency has received over 200,000 unemployment claims in just over two weeks, a number it usually receives during a full year. The department has processed more than 80,000 of the new applications.  As of Wednesday, more than 100 Connecticut resident have died from COVID-19. For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.  In other developments related to the outbreak:   ___   LODGING AND LIQUOR CHANGES  Lamont‘s latest executive order prohibits all hotels, motels, inns, bed and breakfasts, and short-term residential rentals, including those listed on websites like Airbnb and Vrbo, from renting to customers for leisure or vacation purposes. Instead, lodging must be limited to health care workers, first responders, other essential workers, including those transporting materials to hospitals. Also, they’ll be limited to vulnerable populations, such as people who homeless and residents who need a place to self-quarantine.  The order also additional businesses and manufacturers, under certain conditions, to sell liquor for pick-up and delivery to help reduce travel by customers.   ___   PRISONER EMPLOYEES INFECTED  The state Department of Correction said 16 staff members at prisons across the state have tested positive for COVID-19, a sharp increase from the three positive tests among staff reported earlier this week. The department puts the number of infected inmates at eight, including five at the Willard-Cybulski Correctional Institution in Enfield and three at the Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Center in Uncasville. Both prisons have been locked down.  The infected staff members include three who worked at the Hartford Correctional Center and two each at the Cheshire Correctional Institution, MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution in Suffield, New Haven Correctional Center, York Correctional Institution for women in Uncasville and the Carl Robinson Correctional Institution in Enfield. The department reports single infections among staff at Corrigan-Radgowski, the Garner Correctional Institution in Newtown and the the Osborn Correctional Institution in Somers.   ___   VETERANS INFECTED  The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs says there are 41 people being treated in the Connecticut veteran’s health care system for COVID-19. That includes 13 patients who have been hospitalized and 28 being treated as outpatients. The system has hospitals in West Haven and Newington.   ___   NURSING HOMES  The Lamont administration plans to move some residents living in Connecticut’s long-term care facilities to create dedicated spaces for those who have tested positive for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  Under an executive order issued Wednesday night, anyone diagnosed positive in a hospital and later admitted to a nursing home will be monitored and assessed for 14 days in a segregated area with other residents who tested positive.  Meanwhile, any residents of some long-term care facilities who either test negative or display no symptoms will be able to voluntarily transfer to facilities where there are no residents with the virus. Also, under Lamont’s plan, some nursing homes will house only infected individuals.  There are plans to create space in nursing homes that have recently closed, as well.   ___   DETAINED IMMIGRANTS  Advocates for immigrants being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in New England rallied in Hartford on Thursday, arguing the detainees are being held in unsafe conditions because of the outbreak.  A convoy of vehicles, decorated with protest signs, circled outside U.S. District Court in Hartford, honking horns and calling for ICE to free Connecticut residents being held in the Bristol County Correctional Center in Dartmouth, Massachusetts.  A lawsuit filed with the help of Yale Law School’s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy clinic argues the inmates there are being kept in unsanitary bunk rooms where social distancing is not possible.  “The more people ICE continues to arrest, the greater likelihood that COVID-19 sweeps through Bristol County, if it is not there already,” said Megan Yan, a Yale law student intern working on the case. “This continued detention is unjust, inhumane and unconstitutional.”  Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson has dismissed the suit as “completely frivolous.” ICE officials have said they continue “to maintain confidence” in the jail but declined to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit.   ___   CONNECTICUT BUDGET IMPACTS  Melissa McCaw, Lamont‘s budget director, predicted the state’s current fiscal year may end on June 30 with a $500 million budget deficit. The following fiscal year could end up being $1.4 billion in the red. That’s namely because of increased costs associated with addressing the coronavirus pandemic in Connecticut and anticipated sharp declines in revenues from income and sales taxes. Lamont said Connecticut will be receiving $1.45 billion from the latest federal stimulus bill, but that won’t make up for the revenue losses. Connecticut currently have a budget reserve account with $2.5 billion that will likely have to be tapped at some point.   __  Associated Press writers Pat Eaton-Robb and Chris Ehrmann contributed to this report.

The TikTok video shows them concocting a ‘Blue Lives Matter’ drink in an in-store Starbucks, that was prepared with bleach, ice and what they called the blood of innocent black men’  In the footage, Greyson, who is not seen on-screen, is heard narrating their special recipe for the beverage they concocted exclusively for supporters of police.  ‘Hi guys, I updated my recipe for the Blue Lives Matter drinks,’ Greyson is heard saying in the beginning of the clip.  ‘First we’re gonna start with bleach,’ the barista says as they pour more than a cup of blue liquid into a container in the video. ‘All the way to the third line,’ Greyson says.  Greyson then explains that they're going add plenty of ice, ‘because, you know, cops love ice,’ – an apparent allusion to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  The barista then puts together another concoction in a blender that includes a blue coloring that’s used for ‘special’ Starbucks drinks.  ‘And then we add this special blue ingredient that Starbucks has,’ the barista says. ‘We do have it and yes, we are holding out on you.’  The worker then pours the allegedly poisonous contents over the ice and bleach already in the cup.  ‘Pour that right on top. Ahh that beautiful blue color,’ the worker says, before setting the drink on the counter and adding a straw.  ‘And even though it has a straw-less lid, we’re going to serve it with a straw because, ya know, [cops] only think about themselves,’ Greyson concludes, bringing the 40 second clip to an end.  Greyson then explains that they're going add plenty of ice, ‘because, you know, cops love ice,’ – an apparent allusion to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The video does, however, continue to be shared widely on Twitter.  Starbucks confirmed it was aware of the video but declined to comment, pointing out that employees who work in Starbucks locations within Target stores are employed by Target.  The Seattle-based coffee chain did however condemn the ‘video and any behavior that threatens violence against others’.  In their statement, Target said their company has ‘rigorous food safety procedures in place, which this team member egregiously violated with this behavior.  ‘We’re deeply sorry for this disturbing video,’ the company continued.  The spokesperson went on to say that after talking to the employee, the company determined the drink had not actually been served to a guest.  The company also said that they don’t believe actual bleach was used in the making of the drink, rather a combination of milk, water and coloring.  Target was first alerted to the video after a woman downloaded it from TikTok and uploaded it to Twitter, directing the post to Target.  Greyson has since made their Twitter account private.

But America has F-22s and F-35s it can use.  Tensions have escalated in the Persian Gulf region in the aftermath of U.S. president Donald Trump’s decision unilaterally to withdraw the United States from the agreement limiting Iran’s nuclear program.  The U.S. military has implicated Iranian agents in several summer 2019 attacks on civilian ships sailing near Iran. At the time, the U.S. Navy sent the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and her strike group to the region. The U.S. Air Force deployed B-52 bombers and F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters.  If war breaks out, American forces likely will attempt to secure Gulf air space by destroying or suppressing Iran’s air forces. The regular Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force and the air wing of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps militia together operate around 700 aircraft.  The IRIAF’s 1970s-vintage F-14s could be U.S. forces’ first targets. According to a survey by Flight Global, the Iranian air force in 2019 operates around 24 F-14 Tomcats from a batch of 79 of the Grumman-made, swing-wing fighters that Iran acquired in the mid-1970s before the Islamic revolution.  The U.S. Navy retired its last Tomcat in 2006. But with its long range and powerful radar, the F-14 remains one of the world’s most capable fighters. For that reason, the Americans for many years have been trying to ground the Ayatollah’s F-14s.  Sixty-eight of Iran’s F-14s survived the Iran-Iraq War that ended in 1988. Sanctions that the United States imposed after the 1979 revolution prevented Iran from openly acquiring spare parts for the heavyweight fighters.  Tehran established self-sufficiency programs—not just in the air force, but across the nation’s economy—in an effort to satisfy material needs that foreign companies had once met.  In many sectors, the self-sufficiency initiative worked. Besides producing all its own oil, Iran has declared itself autonomous in agriculture, steel production, electricity generation and civil aviation.  But Iranian companies struggled to produce all the specialized parts that the Tomcat requires. Tehran turned to the black market, paying huge sums to shady middlemen to sneak F-14 parts into Iran.  American authorities became aware of the illicit trade as early as 1998. In March that year, federal agents arrested Iranian-born Parviz Lavi at his home in Long Island, charging him with violating U.S. export law by attempting to buy up spare parts for the F-14’s TF-30 engine and ship them to Iran via The Netherlands. Lavi got five years in prison plus a $125,000 fine.  More arrests followed. In 1998, an aircraft parts vendor in San Diego told U.S. customs officials that Multicore Ltd. in California had requested price information for air intake seals used only on the F-14. Agents arrested Multicore’s Saeed Homayouni, a naturalized Canadian from Iran, and Yew Leng Fung, a Malaysian citizen.  “Bank records subpoenaed by the Customs Service showed that Multicore Ltd. had made 399 payments totaling $2.26 million to military parts brokers since 1995 and had received deposits of $2.21 million,” The Washington Post reported . The company shipped parts mostly through Singapore.  The feds began investigating 18 companies that had supplied airplane components to Multicore.  In September 2003, U.S. authorities nabbed Iranian Serzhik Avasappian in a South Florida hotel as part of a sting operation. Agents had showed Avasappian several F-14 parts worth $800,000 and arrested him after he offered to buy the components.  “While these components may appear relatively innocuous to the untrained eye, they are tightly controlled for good reason,” Immigration and Customs Enforcement interim agent Jesus Torres said in a statement. “In the wrong hands, they pose a potential threat to Americans at home and abroad.”  Even with U.S. authorities tamping down on the illicit trade in F-14 parts, Iran persisted. After shutting down Multicore, the feds confiscated the firm’s Tomcat components and sent them to the Defense Department’s surplus-parts office. In 2005, a company—allegedly Iranian—bought the very same parts from the military.  The parts war escalated after the U.S. Navy retired its last F-14s in 2006, leaving Iran as the type’s only operator. In 2007, U.S. agents even seized four intact ex-U.S. Navy F-14s in California—three at museums and one belonging to a producer on the military-themed T.V. show JAG—charging that the F-14s had not been properly stripped of useful parts that could wind up in Iranian hands.  The U.S. Congress was furious at the Pentagon for its lax handling of the F-14-parts problem. Rep. Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, described it as “a huge breakdown, an absolute, huge breakdown.” Lawmakers passed a bill specifically banning any trade in Tomcat components to Iran or any other entity, and then-president George W. Bush signed the law in 2008.  A minor tragedy unfolded as the military paid contractors to dismantle, crush and shred many of the approximately 150 retired F-14s. Scores of old F-14s—properly “demilitarized”—are still on display in museums across the United States. But none remain at the famous airplane “boneyard” in Arizona, where the Pentagon stores retired planes just in case it needs them again.  Even so, the underground trade in Tomcat parts continues, with shady companies scouring the planet for leftover components. In early 2014, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security investigated Israeli arms dealers that it said had twice tried to send F-14 spares to Iran.  And in late 2016, an aviation expert from Dallas named Erik Johnston, a representative of the Fort Worth Aviation Museum and a Union Pacific railroad worker discovered the hulks of two old F-14s on private land in Temple, Texas.  According to The Houston Chronicle, the F-14s somehow wound up in Temple in the late 1980s after the government paid a contractor to scrap the two jets.  It was a suspicious find. Johnston said he was shocked the F-14s for so long escaped the U.S. government’s notice, especially considering Iran’s strong interest in the type. \"The thing that kept stumping us — was why the F-14s were there,\" Johnston mused.

Wochit  WASHINGTON – Seizing an opportunity to consolidate conservative control of the Supreme Court, President Donald Trump on Saturday nominated federal appeals court Judge Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana to replace the late Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  The nomination, overwhelmingly popular among conservatives, comes as Trump trails Democratic nominee Joe Biden in most polls and gives him a chance to change the national conversation from the coronavirus pandemic, racial justice and a troubled economy.  In a 20-minute Rose Garden ceremony, Trump called Barrett “one of our nation’s most brilliant and gifted legal minds\" and virtually dared Democrats to try delaying or blocking her confirmation.  \"Her qualifications are unsurpassed, and her record is beyond reproach. This should be a straightforward and prompt confirmation,\" the president said, adding with a wink, \"I'm sure it will be extremely non-controversial.\"  Barrett paid homage to Ginsburg despite their ideological differences and acknowledged the challenges that face her, both during the confirmation battle and thereafter.  “I have no illusions that the road ahead of me will be easy, either for the short term or the long haul,” she said. But she added: \"I assure you that I will meet the challenge with both humility and courage.”  President Donald Trump introduces 7th U.S. Circuit Court Judge Amy Coney Barrett as his nominee to the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden at the White House September 26, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images)  Who is Amy Coney Barrett?: Talented judge, popular professor brings solid conservative credentials  With Election Day 38 days away, Senate Republicans hope to move quickly to confirm Barrett, 48, to a lifetime appointment on the high court. Only two of the 53 Republicans, Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, oppose voting before the election.  Democrats and liberal interest groups critical of her positions on abortion, health care and other issues appear powerless to block it. Meanwhile, the White House has already set up meetings for Barrett on Capitol Hill, the traditional first step toward Senate confirmation.  If she wins confirmation, Barrett, a devout Catholic, would be the fifth woman to serve on the Supreme Court and Trump's third nominee, joining Associate Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. The past three presidents, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, each appointed only two justices during their eight years in the White House.  Barrett is in many ways the ideological opposite of Ginsburg, the leader of the court's liberal wing who died eight days ago after a lengthy battle with cancer. Barrett was a small child when Ginsburg, as a lawyer, was winning a string of Supreme Court cases on behalf of women's rights. Ginsburg went on to serve 40 years as a judge, including 27 on the Supreme Court.  Amy Coney Barrett: 5 things you need to know about the federal court judge  Still, Barrett took time Saturday to laud the justice she would replace as \"a woman of enormous talent and consequence.\"  \"She not only broke glass ceilings, she smashed them,\" Barrett said. \"For that, she has won the admiration of women all over the country and indeed all over the world.\"  Amy Coney Barrett (Photo: AP)  Trump and Senate Republican leaders want to confirm Barrett before the election – in part because of the contested nature of the election itself. Earlier this week, Trump said he wanted nine justices on the court to decide any legal cases that arise from the voting.  \"We may end up in a dispute for a long time because that's the way they want it,\" Trump said Friday in reference to Democrats promoting mail-in voting. \"But we're going to end up winning.\"  Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., said Barrett will offer a “little more conservative backbone in the court” and joked that her nomination was “one of the worst-kept secrets.” In fact, she was the only person Trump interviewed for the job.  The nomination of Barrett – who serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, based in Chicago – will be a major campaign issue, coming just three days before the president's first debate with Democratic challenger Joe Biden.  Trump clearly hopes to use it to his advantage. At his Saturday night rally near Harrisburg, Pa., a giant red-and-white sign was hoisted with the phrase, \"FILL THAT SEAT!\"  “This nomination is an attack on our very democracy,\" said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America.  More: Ruth Bader Ginsburg makes history as the first woman, Jewish person to lie in state at Capitol ceremony  CLOSE Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has died at age 87. Ginsburg is most noted for her lifelong fight for equality for women. USA TODAY  Republicans and conservative allies applauded Barrett as a strict constructionist who will interpret the Constitution and not make law from the bench.  \"Judge Barrett has impressed the brightest judicial and legal minds with her profound understanding of the law,\" tweeted Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.  Confirming Barrett by Election Day will require an extraordinarily fast schedule against an historic deadline. It customarily takes about 10 weeks to move from a Supreme Court nomination to Senate confirmation. And no justice has been confirmed later than July of an election year.  In a Washington Post-ABC poll earlier this week, 57 percent of Americans said the decision on replacing Ginsburg should await the winner of the presidential election. Only 38 percent said Trump and the current Senate should move ahead.  Fact check: Ginsburg was confirmed in 42 days. But it wasn't an election year.  But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, plan to hold hearings on Barrett in October, with a final Senate vote by early November, right ahead of the election.  Democrats have decried that plan as hypocritical, pointing to what happened in the 2016 election year. Then, the Republican Senate blocked President Barack Obama's nominee to the high court after Associate Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, some nine months before Election Day.  If Trump and the Republicans push Barrett through, Democrats have vowed retaliation should they win control of the Senate in November. Their options range from ending filibuster rights – making it nearly impossible for a Republican minority to block legislation – to increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court to restore ideological balance. They also could move to make Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico states, giving them opportunities to add Democrats to the Senate.  A former Scalia law clerk, Barrett checks most if not all conservative legal boxes. She is an originalist and a textualist, meaning she looks to the words of the Constitution and congressional statutes as written. At 48, she could serve on the court for four decades or more.  If confirmed by Election Day, she could be on the high court in time to hear several major cases this fall, including a third major challenge to the Affordable Care Act.  Trump considered nominating Barrett to the Supreme Court in 2018 after the retirement of Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy. The president instead went with Kavanaugh, who had a much longer tenure as an appeals court judge. Aides said then that the president was saving Barrett for a future high court opening.  Barrett's confirmation would give Republican appointees a 6-3 advantage on the nation's highest court, perhaps locking in conservative dominance for decades on issues such as abortion, civil and voting rights, health care, police powers, free speech and government regulations.  In the Supreme Court term that ended in July, Republican appointees held a 5-4 advantage, though Trump and others questioned just how conservative the court was under the leadership of Chief Justice John Roberts.  Trump has criticized Roberts for occasionally siding with liberal justices, including Ginsburg, to forge 5-4 majorities. Roberts has veered from conservative orthodoxy on abortion, immigration, LGBTQ rights and most notably on President Barack Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act.  On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to nominate more conservative justices, and Barrett's appointment is a fulfillment of that pledge. So, too, are the 53 federal appeals court judges he has named, flipping three circuit courts from having a majority of judges named by Democratic presidents to a majority of judges named by Republican presidents.  Mike Davis, former counsel to Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee who now lobbies for Trump's judicial nominees, heralded Barrett's nomination.  “With the appointment of a Justice Barrett as his third Supreme Court pick, President Trump will transform the 5-4 John Roberts court to the 6-3 Clarence Thomas court,\" Davis said.

She and her husband, Jesse, have seven children, including two adopted from Haiti and one who has Down syndrome.  While she was the overwhelming favorite for the nomination, Trump and aides said he considered at least four other candidates: federal appeals court judges Barbara Lagoa of Florida, Allison Jones Rushing of North Carolina and Joan Larsen of Michigan, and Kate Comerford Todd, a deputy White House counsel.

Hundreds showed up in New York City and thousands in Washington, D.C. for the rallies, which aim to harness the political power of women, although crowds were noticeably smaller than in previous years. Marches were scheduled Saturday in more than 180 cities.  The first marches in 2017 drew hundreds of thousands of people to rallies in cities across the country on the day after President Donald Trump was inaugurated. That year’s D.C. march drew close to 1 million people.  In Manhattan on Saturday, hundreds of people gathered as part of a “Rise and Roar” rally at separate events in Foley Square and Columbus Circle.  “Today, we will be the change that is needed in this world! Today, we rise into our power!” activist Donna Hylton told a cheering crowd in Foley Square.  Snow began falling by the afternoon in Manhattan, apparently putting a damper on plans for the two groups to converge in large numbers near Times Square.  In downtown Los Angeles, thousands of men, women and children filled several blocks as they made their way from a plaza to a park adjacent to City Hall, where a rally featured speeches by Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the wife of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Mayor Eric Garcetti, Rep. Maxine Waters and others.  Jennifer Siebel Newsom credited women for mobilizing against gun violence, creating the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and discrimination, and taking back the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives.  “In 2020, I have no doubt that it will be women who will lead again, rise up and move this country forward on a path toward justice,” she said.  In Denver, organizers opted to skip the rally after the march and instead invited participants to meet with local organizations to learn more about issues such as reproductive rights, climate change, gun safety and voting.  Several thousand came out for the protest in Washington, far fewer than last year when about 100,000 people held a rally east of the White House. But as in previous years, many of the protesters made the trip to the nation’s capital from cities across the country to express their opposition to Trump and his policies. From their gathering spot on Freedom Plaza, they had a clear view down Pennsylvania Avenue to the U.S. Capitol, where the impeachment trial gets underway in the Senate next week.  In Washington, three key issues seemed to galvanize most of the protesters: climate change, immigration and reproductive rights.  “I teach a lot of immigrant students, and in political times like this I want to make sure I’m using my voice to speak up for them,” said Rochelle McGurn, 30, an elementary school teacher from Burlington, Vermont who was in D.C. to march. “They need to feel like they belong, because they do.”  Peta Madry of New London, Connecticut, was celebrating her 70th birthday in D.C. by attending her fourth Women’s March with her sister, Cynthia Barnard, of San Rafael, California. Both women were wearing handknitted pink hats that date from the first march. With pained expressions, they spoke about Trump’s determination to reverse the policies of his predecessor Barack Obama and his treatment of women.  “Look what he’s doing to Greta Thunberg,” Madry said, referring to the teenage climate activist. “He’s the biggest bully in the world.”  Melissa McCullough of Georgetown, Indiana, said when she recently turned 50 she promised herself that she would get more involved politically. “I’m here to protest Trump, as a woman,” she said.  Her daughter, 19-year-old University of Cincinnati student Elizabeth McCullough, chimed in to say that most women’s issues are human issues, and they talked about the need to protect immigrants.  “You have to push to protect everyone or no one’s safe,” Melissa McCullough said.  The protesters planned to march around the White House, but Trump wasn’t there. He is spending the holiday weekend at his resort in Florida.  Organizers of the Washington march faced criticism from some local African American activists for failing to focus on local issues and damaging the ability of local activists to organize.  “Local D.C. is a domestic colony and the actions of national organizers have to recognize that,” Black Lives Matter D.C. wrote in a letter this week to Women’s March organizers. “Here in D.C., these unstrategic mass mobilizations distract from local organizing, often overlook the black people who actually live here and even result in tougher laws against demonstration being passed locally.”   ___  This story has been updated to correct the activist’s name to Donna Hylton, not Hill. ___  Associated Press reporter Daisy Nguyen in San Francisco contributed to this report.

Owing to the chaos swirling around the nation’s capital, this massive giveaway to the powerful agricultural industry lobby is largely escaping notice from the American people.  Under H.R. 5038, an estimated 1.5 million illegal aliens would be eligible for amnesty, but not before having to serve a decade or more in indentured servitude to their employers before achieving full legal status. “Granting amnesty to illegal aliens is always a bad idea, and merely attracts more illegal immigration,” stated Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR).  “The only thing worse than another large-scale amnesty is one that then forces people to continue to toil for poor wages and under poor working conditions for the same unscrupulous employers who hired them illegally in the first place,” said Stein.  Far from modernizing our agricultural workforce, the legislation ensures that the American agricultural industry will remain mired in the 17th century. “The foundation of a modern agricultural industry must be increased reliance on technology and mechanization to ensure that we can feed our population and export our surplus. Instead of offering incentives or subsidies for farmers to invest in real modernization, this bill incentivizes a continued reliance on inefficient, low-wage immigrant labor,” Stein charged.  H.R. 5038 is, at best, a short-term fix for an industry that relies on easily exploitable labor. The bill, which would designate current illegal farmworkers as Certified Agricultural Workers (CAW), is almost an exact replicate of the failed 1986 Special Agricultural Worker (SAW) amnesty. Under that fraud-ridden amnesty program, some 1.1 million illegal aliens received legal status prompting them to leave that industry in pursuit of better wages and working conditions in other sectors of the economy, and leading Big Agriculture to hire the next wave of illegal aliens.  “Mark Twain quipped that ‘History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.’ Congress, in attempting to create a CAW amnesty after the massive failure of the SAW amnesty, seems intent on proving that history can repeat itself and rhyme at the same time,” Stein observed.  “While Congress continues to do nothing to secure our borders, passing a bill that rewards both illegal aliens and their employers, and calling it ‘modernization,’ is a slap in the face to the plurality of Americans who consider immigration to be the nation’s most pressing domestic issue,” concluded Stein.

Boris Johnson yesterday landed in the pages of The Times with an article promising a route to British citizenship for up to three million people living in Hong Kong who, at the moment, have a right to British National (Overseas) passports.  This was a generous and honourable thing to do. China is threatening to impose a new security law on the former British colony, which would bring it under the heel of Beijing.  Many Hong Kong inhabitants would find living under an autocratic regime intolerable.  Boris Johnson yesterday landed in the pages of The Times with an article promising a route to British citizenship for up to three million people living in Hong Kong who, at the moment, have a right to British National (Overseas) passports. Pictured: At the Downing Street coronavirus press conference last night  Like others in the Tory Party, Mr Johnson feels guilty that more was not done to protect Hong Kongers when the territory was handed back to China in 1997, though it was supposed to retain a large degree of autonomy until 2047.  Those freedoms have been whittled away, and may soon be consigned to history.  Let’s be in no doubt that the Prime Minister’s undertaking amounts to a major commitment which dwarfs the sudden admission of some 27,000 Ugandan Asians in 1972 on the run from the tyrant Idi Amin.  They proved to be of great benefit to the economy.  As a result of the Prime Minister’s offer, it is theoretically possible that hundreds of thousands — indeed, millions — of Hong Kong Chinese could choose to settle here in the foreseeable future, if Beijing continues to clamp down.  Beijing's spokesperson Zhao Lijian (pictured) lodged stern representations with the UK as he accused Britain of 'blindly commenting on and grossly interfering in our domestic affairs' yesterday  Do the British people want this to happen? Could our creaking infrastructure, and hard-pressed schools and hospitals, cope with such an influx? What about housing?  There is a dire shortage of homes as it is, which would only be made worse by a new wave of immigration.  My strong suspicion is that neither the Prime Minister nor the Cabinet has had the time or inclination to give much, if any, thought to these questions in the midst of a pandemic. Not for the first time, Boris is thinking with his heart.  On the whole — though not without some reservations, which I’ll come to later — I’m on his side. Honour is important in politics.  Even at this late stage, we shouldn’t abandon our former colonial subjects to an increasingly brutal and nasty regime.  People wearing protective face masks hold placards as they attend a candlelight vigil ahead of the 31st anniversary of the crackdown of pro-democracy protests at Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, after police rejects a mass annual vigil on public health grounds, in Hong Kong last night  Back in the late 1980s, the Tory hierarchy was unwilling to countenance mass immigration from Hong Kong. Norman Tebbit, who was one of Margaret Thatcher’s key lieutenants, feared in 1989 that ‘Britain would be swamped by people of different culture, history and religion’.  He said this about six months after the Chinese regime had murdered an unknown number of demonstrators (probably several thousand) in the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing.  Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe said something similar in milder terms at a lunch I attended around the same time. In his opinion, those who proposed throwing open our doors to the Hong Kong Chinese were naive, and didn’t understand the British people. They would never put up with it.  Thirty years later — and after unprecedented levels of immigration from the EU and elsewhere which would have seemed inconceivable three decades ago — No 10 has reached the opposite conclusion.  The people of Hong Kong undoubtedly have a great deal to offer our economy. Its work force is highly trained and, according to international comparisons, better educated than its British counterpart.  Though immigrants from the territory would need schools and hospitals like everyone else, they would very likely make an enormous contribution, and not represent any kind of drain.  Hong Kong is a dynamic and entrepreneurial society with a per capita income 50 per cent greater than ours.  Nor is it certain, if Chinese policies were to trigger a large-scale exodus, that a majority of Hong Kongers would want to come here.  Countries such as Canada, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand would compete to attract well-trained, highly skilled and often well-funded immigrants.  It’s likely, by the way, that Beijing would be happy to see the back of them. It would have got rid of people it regards as dangerous malcontents, whose liberal yearnings could otherwise spread like a contagion to China itself.  Hong Kong’s separate identity would be erased.  All in all, there are many reasons for thinking that granting nearly three million Hong Kong people eventual British citizenship could be a great boon — as well as a resounding blow struck in the name of honour and decency.  But there are dangers. What would happen if the situation in Hong Kong deteriorated so rapidly that hundreds of thousands of its citizens sought to come to Britain in a very short period of time?  Unlikely, you may say, and it probably is. But projecting future immigration flows is a mug’s game.  If Boris has bothered to ask anyone in the Home or Foreign Office of the magnitude of a possible influx, he has almost certainly been given a wrong answer.  A pro-democracy demonstrator raises his British National Overseas (BNO) passports during a protest against new national security legislation in Hong Kong on Monday  Never forget that in 2004, when the Blair government gave the green light to immigration from Poland and seven other Eastern European states, it forecast a very modest annual number of migrants — between 5,000 and 13,000.  Within five years, nearly a million had arrived.  Assuming the Prime Minister is sincere in the munificent offer he made in his article — and there is no reason to suppose he isn’t — the Government would be wise to envisage the possibility of a torrent rather than a trickle.  In short, a proper plan, rather than a well-intentioned gesture, is needed.  Other countries should be involved, partly to put pressure on China to reconsider its security law (several voices are likely to be more effective than one), and partly to discuss how they might collectively provide a home for Hong Kongers, should it come to that.  Will Boris Johnson’s undeniably provocative initiative induce the Chinese government to calm down? I rather doubt it.  Beijing's rubber-stamp parliament last week approved a national security law to ban what it deems as 'subversion, treason and foreign interference' in Hong Kong. Pictured, protesters march again Beijing's plans to impose national security legislation in Hong Kong on May 24  Beijing’s immediate angry response — accompanied by the usual claptrap about Britain’s ‘colonial mindset’ — doesn’t suggest an imminent capitulation.  The Prime Minister’s enemies on the Left often scatter accusations against him of racism and heartlessness. I’d say his proposal of ultimate British citizenship for up to three million Hong Kong Chinese amounts to pretty incontrovertible evidence of how unjustified such charges are.  It’s worth noting that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Home Secretary Priti Patel are enthusiastically behind him.  The former’s Jewish father came to the UK in 1938 as a six-year-old from Czechoslovakia after the country had been partly absorbed by the Nazis. The latter’s parents both left Uganda in the 1960s.  As for the wider Tory Party, I’m pretty sure it harbours a degree of historical guilt over the refusal of the Thatcher administration to agree to significant immigration from Hong Kong in the late 1980s.  That wrong should be put right if China continues along its present destructive path. But Boris mustn’t forget the ill-will and unhappiness in many parts of the country caused by uncontrolled immigration during the first two decades of this century.  For goodness’ sake, it was the resentment of these long-ignored people that, in large measure, led to Brexit. This time, if it comes to it, the Government must get it right.

[Video and Transcript]   .  [Transcript] – THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. Great to be here. Beautiful runway. A little warmer than I’m used to, but that’s okay, Doug, right? We have a — I was just given a beautiful picture of the wall. That’s before and after. And that’s quite a difference: one area you walk over, you drive over, you do whatever you want, and other one you say, “Well, I guess we don’t get in.” Here’s another one — just given. That’s great. That’s a different section. Pretty amazing.  They’ve done a great job; we’re up to 212 — more than that now, about 220 — but over 212 miles, and we’ll be very close to 500 miles by the end of the year. And that’s the area that we wanted.  So it’s great and thank you all for being here. Thank you very much. And I’m thrilled to be in Yuma, Arizona. They’ve treated me very nicely in Arizona. So we’re very happy about that, Mr. Governor. Right? To commemorate the completion of more than 200 miles of powerful border wall.  We’re on pace to complete 450 miles by the end of the year, and 500 miles, almost immediately thereafter. We may even have the 500 miles by the end of the year. We’re doing a real job. The Army Corps of Engineers, I want to thank them. They’ve been incredible.  This is the most powerful and comprehensive border wall structure anywhere in the world. It’s got technology that nobody would even believe, between sensors and cameras and everything else.  With us today are Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, who has done a fantastic job. Thank you, Chad. Commissioner Mark Morgan. Mark, thank you very much. Lieutenant General Todd Semonite, who’s doing a fantastic job at the Army Corps. We have interesting construction talk, don’t we?  LIEUTENANT GENERAL SEMONITE: Yes, sir.  THE PRESIDENT: Really great stuff.  President of the National Border Patrol Council, Brandon Judd. Hello, Brandon. What are you doing sitting back there? I’ve never seen that before. You’re always up here with me. You’re getting low key lately, huh? That’s confidence. That means he’s got a lot of confidence. That’s great. And thank you for everything, Brandon. Say hello to everybody. Great job you do. Appreciate it.  He was a supporter of mine before I ran. He said, “I hope that guy runs.” Right? So I appreciate it very much. We won’t forget it either.  And several other very dedicated and heroic members of law enforcement. I met just a few of them back there and they gave me a beautiful replica of the wall, a little shorter version, but that’s okay. And we want to thank everybody.  We’re also joined by some of my very good friends and people I have great respect for you. You have a great governor in this state. And he’s been a great friend for the state, but he’s been a great friend to our nation and does a — just a great job: Doug Ducey. Thank you very much, Doug.  GOVERNOR DUCEY: Thank you, Mr. President.   THE PRESIDENT: Appreciate it.   GOVERNOR DUCEY: Thank you.  THE PRESIDENT: Talk to you in a little while. Appreciate it.  Senator Martha McSally, who I hear is doing very well. We need you in Washington. Will you please win?  SENATOR MCSALLY: Yes, sir. (Inaudible.)  THE PRESIDENT: Because we need you. The alternative that’s running against you is not the person that we want, where he’s got — he’s got things that we don’t want. So we want you to win this race. It’s very important. And we appreciate all the help that you’ve given us, especially on the border wall. We appreciate it, Martha. Thank you very much.  Representative Debbie Lesko has become a tremendous friend of mine and supporter. And with the impeachment hoax, she was right up front. And it was good for you. You became very famous. I became more famous and you became very, very famous. Right?  REPRESENTATIVE LESKO: Well, you helped me. Thank you.  THE PRESIDENT: Well, it certainly didn’t hurt. She was one of the really great advocates, who’s terrific. We appreciate it, Debbie. Thank you.  Yuma Mayor Douglas Nicholls. And thank you, Douglas, very much for being here.  MAYOR NICHOLLS: Thank you. Welcome back to Yuma.  THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Doug. It’s really an honor.  And Yuma Police Chief, Susan Smith. Thank you, Susan, very much for being here.  So my administration has done more than any administration in history to secure our southern border. Our border has never been more secure. I think Doug can tell you that. Anybody at this table can tell you that. It’s never even been close.  The numbers now, including not only the wall — the wall has helped a lot, where we have that 200 miles — 212 and now 220 — it’s really, essentially, almost, I guess 99.6 or something like that. Maybe somebody can get an extraordinarily long ladder, but once you get up there, it gets very high. And it’s just about unclimbable. So it’s — it’s really great. That’s made a big difference, but we have other things that we’ve done.  During the past two months, we’ve seen the lowest number of illegal border crossings in many years. Illegal immigration is down 84 percent from this time last year. Illegal crossings from Central America are down 97 percent.  Now, the news — I won’t say “fake news”; I want to be nice today. So the news will say “97 percent,” Doug. “That’s not very good.” But 97 percent, I would say, sounds pretty good.   GOVERNOR DUCEY: A-plus.  THE PRESIDENT: You sure it’s 97 right?  ACTING COMMISSIONER MORGAN: Yes, sir.  THE PRESIDENT: Ninety-seven. That’s a pretty good —  ACTING COMMISSIONER MORGAN: Yes, sir.  THE PRESIDENT: That’s a pretty good number you’re doing. Ninety-seven percent down. Nearly 450,000 pounds of drugs have been seized this year, and 2,337 criminal aliens have been apprehended. We’ve stopped asylum fraud, ended catch and release.  If you look at so many of the different crimes that come through the border, they’re stopped. We’ve implemented groundbreaking agreements with Mexico. I want to thank the President of Mexico. He’s really a great guy. I think he’ll be coming into Washington pretty soon, to the White House.  But they have a total of — what’s the number today, would you say? Soldiers? What would you say?  ACTING COMMISSIONER MORGAN: Over 20,000, sir.  THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Over 20. So we’ve had 27,000, 28,000, 25,000 Mexican soldiers are on our border making sure people aren’t coming across.  So I want to also say that we’ve made a lot of progress with Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. And now, when somebody comes over, whether it’s MS-13 or anybody else, we bring them back and they take them gladly. In the previous administration, they didn’t take them at all. They wouldn’t take them. They said, “You keep them.”  Using our emergency public health authorities, we prevented a coronavirus catastrophe on the southern border, shutting down human smuggling and swiftly returning the crossers — we call them “crossers.” They cross now, and we bring them right back. In the old days, it would take years to get them back. They wouldn’t get them back. Other administrations, like the previous administration, essentially didn’t bring them back.  Without these public health measures, the southern border would be a global epicenter of the viral transmission. And if you look at some of the towns on the other side of the wall — as an example, in California, we have a certain area that is heavily infected on the Mexico side. And if we didn’t have a border wall there, it would be a — it would be really a catastrophic situation.  So I just want to thank everyone. The Biden people — and he’s controlled totally by the radical left, as you understand. He’s not controlling it; they’re controlling him. They want open borders. They want criminal sanctuaries. They want everything that doesn’t work. I don’t even think it works politically, frankly, at this point. People see what happened.  You’ll take a look at what’s happening in Seattle, or take a look — Minnesota is such a great, great state, but you look at Minneapolis and you see what happened there. Until we sent in — we sent in the National Guard. We said, “You got to do it.” As soon as they were there, boom, it shut down. All the problems they had shut down. You didn’t hear about them anymore. And many other places.  Last night in Washington, we heard they were going to take down the statue — Washington, D.C. — the statue of Andrew Jackson. A beautiful statue in Lafayette Park. And Mark Meadows is here. He heard about it. I heard about it. We sent people there. And law enforcement did an incredible job. They ran into that place. And we were minutes away. That was a sneak attack.  And now we’ve enacted an act, a very specific statue and monument act that puts people in jail for 10 years if they do anything to even try to deface one of our monuments or statues. So we have numerous people in prison right now; others are going there. And we’re going to look at that from a standpoint of retroactivity. We can go back and look at some of the damage they’ve done.  But largely, it’s state damage, because the states have been very weak — extremely weak in protecting their heritage and protecting their culture. So the states are going to have to take care of themselves, but we’re with — we’re there to help. If they want, we’ll gladly help.  But the federal statues, monuments, buildings, various things that we have, including if you look at the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial. They want to take down George Washington. How about that one? That’s a new one. We heard that the other day — George Washington. I don’t think we’ll let that happen, Doug, right? I don’t think we’re going to let that happen. But George Washington and so many others. They — I really don’t even think, frankly, they know who they’re taking down. I think they just want to do things for bad purposes.  So — and these aren’t protestors. These are agitators and others. So we’ve taken a very strong stance. And it won’t be happening federally. If it does, they’re going to pay a very big price and they know that. It won’t be happening with the federal statues and monuments.  So with that, I’d like to just introduce Chad Wolf to say a few words about the border — the job we’ve done on general security, not just the southern border. The southern border has been a primary focus, as everyone knows, because tremendous amounts of drugs and other things come down. Human trafficking, we have that down to the lowest number we’ve had in many years. And again, being helped a lot by the length of our wall, which is going to be complete very soon.  So, Chad, say a few words, please.  ACTING SECRETARY WOLF: Well, thank you, Mr. President. And we’re here today as a testament to your leadership and determination to secure our nation’s borders. In recent weeks, as you’ve mentioned, our country has witnessed an all-out attack against our law enforcement. Thankfully, you have not stood idly by. Instead, you’re supporting the brave law enforcement officers who sacrifice so much for all of us every day. And nowhere is that support as important as it is here at the southwest border.  Border security is homeland security. The first priority of any nation is to ensure the sovereignty by protecting the integrity of its borders.  Mr. President, you have disregarded the ineffective conventional wisdom put forth by folks in D.C. and have instead listened to your operators. And they have been very clear: They want an effective and lasting border wall system. And you’ve been — you’ve responded by making available over $15 billion to fund this critical capability. And so your support of the men and women of DHS and CBP are — is beyond comparison.  Others, such as General Semonite and Commissioner Morgan will talk to you about the attributes of the wall, but let me just focus on a few key issues that you also brought up that goes into securing our borders — not only the border wall system, but we are also closing loopholes that have served as magnets over the last three years, enticing migrants to take a very dangerous journey north to the U.S. and enter our country illegally.  We have entered into a number of game-changing agreements with our Northern Triangle partners to stem the flow of illegal migrants as well.  We’ve demanded — you specifically have demanded Mexico step up their efforts, and we’re seeing more and more migrants being turned around at Mexico’s southern border before they reach our own.  We’re also addressing abuse, as you mentioned, of the asylum system, clamping down on the use of frivolous asylum claims to illegally obtain work authorization here in the U.S.  And we’re also disrupting and dismantling dangerous cartels by leveraging the unique capabilities of the United States Coast Guard as well as the United States Navy. And we’re attacking these criminals where they’re most vulnerable, and that’s at the sea.  And perhaps, most importantly, you took decisive action to restrict travel to the U.S. during COVID-19. And you’ve taken recent action to put American workers first as we reopen the economy.  So, Mr. President, I want to thank you once again for your support of the men and women of DHS, also for your support of law enforcement across the country, but particularly here along the southwest border.  We look forward to continuing our work on the border wall system and making the border even more secure.  THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. You know, when we first came, there was a thing called the “caravan.” And you’d have caravans, you’d have these massive amounts of people coming up, and they’d be coming from sometimes Honduras or Guatemala, El Salvador, other countries. They’d come through those countries sometimes, but thousands and thousands of people. I guess the largest one we saw was maybe 15,000. That’s a lot of people.  ACTING SECRETARY WOLF: It’s large.  THE PRESIDENT: And very dangerous for those people too. Things that happened on that journey up were brutal, and it was a long journey. But we don’t have that anymore because they know they can’t get through. And when they know they can’t get through, they don’t want to go through that.  So, you know, we’ve told other countries, “You can’t do that. You can’t have caravans.” And they listened to us, so it was a big — it’s a big difference right now. Tremendous difference.   Mark, please.  ACTING COMMISSIONER MORGAN: Yes, sir. So a couple things. First, I want to echo what the Secretary said, sir. I want to say, as Commissioner of CBP, thank you. Thank you from early on. You listened where others before you have not. I think Brandon Judd could testify to that. Early on — right, Brandon? — he was engaging you. And you engaged the experts who are on the frontlines every day, risking their lives for this country. And you asked them, “What do you need?” And one of the things they said is, “We need an effective border wall system.” And, Mr. President, you have delivered that.  And to echo what the Secretary said too, we also concur that border security is national security. It’s just commonsense. We have to know who and what is coming through our borders and to our borders, and we have to be able to defend that.  With every new mile of new wall system, the operational capacity of CBP, specifically Border Patrol, is increased. Our ability to enforce the rule of law has increased. Our ability to maintain integrity in the immigration system has increased. Our ability to improve border security has increased. And our ability to shape and drive the behavior of the cartels has also increased. Our ability to impede, deny, and stop the vast threats that we have have increased because of your leadership and providing us the tools, like the wall system.  And I think this is also important, and we — we’ve talked about this before: It’s not just a wall. I keep saying “wall system” on purpose, because what you have delivered is something that has not been delivered before. It’s not just a bunch of steel in the ground. It’s that plus access roads, technology, other attributes that really makes it an effective wall system and gives us a capability that we have not had before.  And that’s why I stay true to the fact when I’m asked — the 220 miles of wall system we have in right now are 220 new miles of wall system that gives us an enhanced capability that we never had.  Stopping drugs at the border, that’s what we should do. That helps reduce the tens of thousands of American citizens that have died every year at the hands of the cartels smuggling drugs across this border.  Stopping human smuggling at the border prevents and reduces the ability of women and children to be lost, abandoned, and further exploited by the cartels.  Stopping criminals and gangs at the border reduces violent crime in every city in this country.  Stopping infectious disease, like COVID-19, at the border has saved countless lives, and that is due to your leadership.  And that’s why we say all the time that every town, city, and state is a border town, border city, border state. Everything that touches our border touches every city, town, and state in this country, and that’s why we have said and we will continue to say borders matter; the wall matters.  And I want to end by saying a special thanks also to General Todd Semonite. It’s been an incredible relationship that we’ve had. His “wall team,” as we call it, and CBP’s wall team, we’ve worked together for the past few years and making this happen. And I am 100 percent convinced that we will reach that 450 miles by the end of the calendar year.  THE PRESIDENT: That’s great. Yes, I think we’ll do that. Todd, go ahead, please.  LIEUTENANT GENERAL SEMONITE: Well, sir, first of all, thanks for having us in. And the Corps of Engineers is exceptionally honored to work on one of these largest infrastructure projects in our country. And the Commissioner talked about the team. I mean, it goes to Secretary Wolf, all the CBP agents — phenomenal people. We couldn’t do this alone. And it’s just a very noble calling to be able to put this in place.  Just to be able to talk to you a little bit: Again, this is a four-state program, about $15 billion, 49 different projects that are being done right now. And I’m just going to give you a quick couple of numbers here.  There are 220 miles that are complete. They’re done. We’re doing about a mile a day right now. Under contract right now being built, put in the ground, steel and concrete: 384 miles. And then we’ve got another 129 miles that are actually — we’re working through real estate, we’re working through the design, and we continue to get all that in. So that would be somewhere over 700 miles that’s already under work and being done.  That’s a hundred and — there’s 144,000 panels that are being put in the ground. These are 8 feet wide, 30 or 18 feet high — already in place, in concrete. So it’s a pretty massive system.  Today, we’re actually looking at what we call the “Yuma primary.” This is 26 miles, cost about $267 million, 51,000 cubic yards of concrete, about 36,000 tons of steel. And, sir, what we’ve got in this particular project is about 17,000 panels. So a lot going on there.  And I just want to end by looking at the elected officials of Arizona, and it goes to the other states as well. CBP, the Corps of Engineers, we’re absolutely committed to do this where it is as — environmentally, less impact as possible. We want to put as many jobs as we can into the local community.  We want to continue to make sure that we are doing — going overboard on COVID compliance. And, right now, our contractors have some of the most stringent measures in America before — to make sure, before they ever walk on the workspace, they’re being as safe as they absolutely can. And if there’s anything else that we need to do to be able to make sure we’re working very, very close with your constituents, we are committed to do that.  So, sir, we’re honored to be here and we got a lot of great things going on.  THE PRESIDENT: Great job. Thank you very much, Todd.  Brandon, could I ask you to say a few words? Because you were the ones that said — you told me, “We need a wall. You got to get the wall.”  MR. JUDD: Well, first, President, actions speak much louder than words. You’re the only President in my 20-year — 23-year career that has actually come down to the border multiple times to look at and assess what actually needs to be done.  Your agents — I normally call them my agents, but they are your agents — your agents appreciate the fact that you’ve gone above and beyond well — more than any other President in the history of my career.  Your agents want two things: They want border security, which is security for the entire United States, and they want economic security for their family, for their friends, and for their loved ones. You built the strongest economy in my lifetime. We trust that you’re going to continue to build that economy.  Pandemic hit. Nobody saw it coming. Nobody could have predicted it. You will build that economy, and we trust that you will build that economy. You’ve done more to secure the border. We are at historic lows. And you’ve done it twice, not just once. None of your predecessors were able to do that.  You’ve talked with the men and women of the Border Patrol. You’ve invited me to the Oval Office on multiple occasions to consult with what the boots on the ground want. They have consistently told you: Walls in strategic locations work. It allows us to dictate where traffic goes. It allows us to be a lot more effective.  You, not your predecessors, have done that. You built the economy. You have provided border security. And you continue to do it, and we continue to look forward to working with you. Thank you.  THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Brandon, very much. It was very interesting because Brandon was telling me, right at the beginning, we needed the wall, and what kind of wall we need, and you have to have a vision through the wall. If you don’t have the vision through — and then we met, and you all agreed.  But we met with your people. We had various design competitions for — I said, “If we’re going to build it, let’s build it right.” And we had design competitions. The wall that was hardest to get over, the wall that was impossible to climb or certainly very, very hard — and this was the hardest. And we built the top of the line.  But you were really a great help. Thank you, Brandon, very much.  So a man that’s been so much — has just done a great job for the area and very — is so into security of this state, of this great state of Arizona — and I just think he’s really a fantastic guy, the governor. Could you say a few words, please, Doug?  GOVERNOR DUCEY: Sure, (inaudible). One, welcome back to Arizona, Mr. President. It’s good to have you here and, I want to say, to be down on the border.  For years, Arizonans have heard empty talk about the border, and this is the first administration that has taken action. So I want to say how grateful I am for the partnership with Homeland Security; how your Border Patrol, your Customs and Border Protection, and ICE have all been helpful. The Army Corps of Engineers — not only what they’re doing on the wall, but what they’re doing for a potential surge capacity around COVID-19, I think, shows the best of what’s possible when there’s a partnership between the federal government and the state government. And it’s been your leadership that has allowed there to be real action.  And in 2014, when I was first elected, there were large areas of Arizona’s border that were wide open and unprotected. And on this 220-mile stretch, now there is border security, which is national security, and that will stop drug cartels, human traffickers, and child sex traffickers.  And your top folks have partnered with the Border Strike Force in Arizona. And as a result, we’ve kept dangerous drugs and this poison out of our schools and neighborhoods, as well as protecting people who are not being trafficked over the border.  So, I’m grateful, and I know there’s more to do because the border is longer than 220 miles, and I look forward to working with you in the coming years to complete the job.  THE PRESIDENT: We’ll have it mostly complete by the end of the year, and there may be a little — we may add a little, and then we may find spots where we want to add. But we’ll have everything we wanted pretty much by the end of the year. That’s great, Doug. Thank you. Great job you’re doing.  And, Martha, you’re there, and you’ve been such a help, and I appreciate it. And I know how you feel about border security, maybe better than anybody —   SENATOR MCSALLY: Yes, sir.  THE PRESIDENT: — but I just want to thank you for your help. Please say a few words.  SENATOR MCSALLY: Absolutely. Mr. President, welcome back to Arizona. It was an honor to fly with you on Air Force One and bring you back for this commemoration.  I feel like we were just here recently for the 100th mile, and so it just shows with the partnership that’s been talked about here how quickly you’ve been able to enact this border wall system to give the agents everything that they need in order to secure our border.  And I know our mayor knows the impact of that on this community, and the sector chief here. Border Security is national security. It’s also health security. I think people have realized now, in this pandemic, that borders matter, and they matter for the safety and security of the state and the whole nation.  And the drugs that have been flowing through easily that are impacting and killing loved ones around America — it has to stop, and this border wall system is a huge part of stopping the cartel activity; stopping that poison from coming across; and giving these agents everything they need, as we support law enforcement for everything they do in order to keep us safe at the federal and at the local level.  So thanks for your leadership and your partnership on this. Welcome back to Arizona.  THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thanks, Martha. Great job. Appreciate it.  Debbie, go ahead. Come on.   REPRESENTATIVE LESKO: Well —  THE PRESIDENT: Let’s see if you can do it again. (Laughter.)  REPRESENTATIVE LESKO: You know, I’m — I’m on the ground, I’m on Judiciary Committee and Homeland Security committees, so I see firsthand how many of my Democratic colleagues really want to prioritize illegal immigrants over U.S. citizens and they really do want open borders.  I mean, I don’t understand it, but they do. And so there’s such a clear difference between you and your future opponent in this issue and Democrats as whole.  I mean, I sat in Judiciary Committee when Chairman Jerry Nadler said that the Border Patrol officers were guilty of child abuse. And I think they said to Mr. Morgan that he was guilty of negligent homicide. I mean, the insanity of what they’re saying and the difference is so clear between what the Democrats want for the future of our nation and what you are doing to make us safe and make our country safe, and I want to thank you for that.  THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think one of the all-time classics — and I’m sure you all remember it well — was they had a picture of a cage, in the New York Times and other places, and it was a cage for children. And they said President Trump built it and how horrible it was. And they still talk about it, even though they know it’s not true.  And somebody wrote in, “No, no, that cage was built in 2014 by President Obama.”   REPRESENTATIVE LESKO: That’s right.  THE PRESIDENT: I guess you could say Biden, but I don’t think Biden knew too much about it, frankly. He still doesn’t. But it was built by President Obama.  And Mark called, who was around this business for a long time. He said, “That wasn’t built by President Trump; that was built by President Obama in 2014.” They gave me an exact date. Actually, they gave me the date it was constructed, meaning a series of cages. And I’ve, sort of, never forgotten it.  And they still say that. You know, they still take — take that same picture. That’s why they get called the “fake news,” and it’s too bad because they ought to straighten it out. It would be so good for our country.  But, no, that was built in 2014, and I never forgot it. Somehow, I never forgot it.  Anyway, Mr. Mayor, would you like to say something?  MAYOR NICHOLLS: Thank you very much, Mr. President, and thanks again for coming back to Yuma. But thank you, more importantly, for last year when you helped us through a big surge of the Central American families. The folks with DHS really stepped up and addressed the very specific concern we had.  Now, if you fast-forwarded that situation to today and those families were coming through with COVID, that would be 5,200 people coming through my community, potentially with COVID. So, the wall — it’s simple math: The wall prevents people from coming, that prevents the number of exposures we can have to COVID. So, from local perspective, that helps our community.  But the men and women of DHS that live here — they’re our residents, they’re our friends, they’re our family members, and it’s a very personal and very poignant fact for us to have those kind of protections in place.  So, thank you very much.  THE PRESIDENT: Well, you have to see San Diego. So, on the other side of San Diego is a tremendously big problem with COVID and other things. And they wanted that wall so badly — you know, you don’t hear this about California. They wanted that wall. They were calling. Everybody was call- — I won’t even tell. I won’t embarrass them by saying who called. But people that didn’t want the wall outside wanted the wall.  And I built the wall, and it worked 100 percent. You know what I’m talking about. And then, I see one of the politicians two weeks later. “They should take down the wall.” By the way, it worked so well. But he was saying, “They should’ve taken down the wall.” But now they don’t even say that, because now it stopped COVID; it stopped everything. It stopped the whole deal. And you’ve had it, and you see the experience. And we’re going to take a good look at a big chunk that we have right in your backyard, right here.  And I know it’s made a big difference for Yuma, and that’s great. You’ve done a fantastic job. Thank you very much.  Chief, would you like to say something?  CHIEF SMITH: Yes, sir. Welcome, Mr. President, to Yuma. And I really first want to thank you very much for your support of law enforcement, local and federal. It’s much needed right now, and it’s appreciated.  I can tell you: I worked on the road back in the early 2000s, and I understand firsthand the calls for service related to undocumented immigrants and how high those calls for service were. And then, after the border enhancement security measures were put into place, I can tell you that we saw a marked decline in many of those calls — those crimes associated with undocumented immigrants, such as load vehicles coming across with drugs and humans, human trafficking, stolen vehicles, and other crimes related. So it’s very much appreciated, and it has helped with the security in Yuma County.  One thing I want you to take away is that Yuma County is a very unique community in that all of the law enforcement work very collaboratively together, from our federal, state, and local partners. So I hope you get that takeaway when you leave here.  THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Appreciate it. I look forward to seeing it.   Please.  DIRECTOR CARROLL: Thank you, Mr. President. As your principal drug advisor, when we first told you about China and fentanyl coming in from over there, you took decisive action and you held China accountable. We explained about South America and drugs coming up through the Caribbean, and you had Secretary Esper do a surge out at sea to prevent the boats from bringing the drugs into our country. And as we’re talking about today, when we talked about the southwest border, you already knew it, but you knew to took action, and you did it. And you are now taking a tough stance here at the southwest border.  We talked about treatment, and we talked about the need to make sure that people get help. You committed more funds than any other President in history. You also talked about the importance of preventing kids from going down this path — on prevention. You committed more funds than any other President in history.  And you did everything with one purpose in mind, and that is to save more American lives. And you have done it. For 30 years, drug deaths were going up. Last year, prior to COVID, first time in three decades, the number of Americans dying from a drug overdose went down, and that’s because of all the action you have taken on treatment, prevention, and stopping drugs from coming into our country and killing our children.  It’s been a great honor to be able to work for you in this capacity and see your passion for saving American lives.  THE PRESIDENT: That was really nice. I appreciate that very much. We are working very hard on it. So I appreciate it. You’re doing a great job, too.  DIRECTOR CARROLL: Thank you, Mr. President.   THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.   Please.  DEPUTY CHIEF LUNDRUM: Mr. President, thank you for visiting Yuma Sector Border Patrol. The agents here, the men and women of this sector, have put in tireless days the past several years in the recent surge across the southwest border. Here in this sector, even though — even though Yuma is a small sector — the second smallest sector on the southwest border; less than 800 agents here in this sector — even though that is the case, we were the third-busiest sector on the southwest border.  And what that looked like here is: In 2017, we had over 12,000 apprehensions, which was more than a 100 percent increase. One year later, in 2018, we had 26,000. Again, another 100 percent increase. One year after that — last year, 2019, over 68,000 apprehensions here.  And it takes a while for the government — for leadership represented here today, for the members, the elected officials here today — it takes a while for those resources to flow in. And the agents, we — we know they’re coming. We believe they’re coming, but now we know it. We see it on the ground. We see what flew in here over the past year to help us out when we were in dire straits in this sector.  We did not have the capacity we needed, facilities-wise. We did not have the resources we needed. But the agents really fought through that — drove through that, and they did what was right. Because every single person that was coming over here — even though, yes, they broke the law, they still had to be taken care of while they were in our custody. We still had to step up and get that part done.  And to do that, we leveraged state officials. We leveraged the local community. You know, we leveraged NGOs in the area to help us.  But now — you know, thank you for your leadership, because now those resources have arrived. And now, in this sector, we’re receiving 110 miles of new wall system. And out there, right now, today, is more than 60 miles already built, already completed, and that 60 miles makes a huge difference.  Every single mile of new wall system that is put in and every single mile, both — both illegal entries in that particular area, drug smuggling in that particular area, border crime in that particular area has decreased in every single mile that new wall system gets put in.  And I thank you for the leadership. I thank everybody at the table today for leadership around the room, in order to take on this particular effort and help Yuma Sector Border Patrol in doing what we need to do to help secure the United States.  So thank you very much, Mr. President.  THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Those are incredible numbers.  And I just want to say: This was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to do because we had to raise, you know, large amounts of money. As you were saying, this was one of the biggest projects you’ve ever worked on.  LIEUTENANT GENERAL SEMONITE: Yes, sir.  THE PRESIDENT: It’s a tremendous — you know, you hear it’s a wall, but it’s a wall that’s very big and very long and very powerful. And the Democrats didn’t want to do it. They just didn’t want to do it, Doug, no matter what. It didn’t matter. And these are people that voted in favor of it 10 years ago, but they never got it built because they didn’t know how to build it — because building it is tough, too. But I do that, and we know how to build.  But they tried to block it. They did everything in their power to block it. And it’s very interesting because, in the end, it sort of just went through and the military helped us and we’re getting it built regardless. But they don’t like bringing it up and it’s never mentioned anymore; the wall is never mentioned anymore.  The reason it’s not mentioned: It’s not that we won the battle. It’s that it’s such a compelling thing to have done. Because you see the numbers, and where that wall is going, as you’re saying, it’s like — it’s like magic. You don’t have to do — it saves tremendous manpower and womanpower. It saves tremendous human resources and saves lives.  But they want open borders and they don’t want walls. And they fought harder than anybody I’ve ever seen. And in the end, they quit. They gave up. The reason they gave up: Because, politically, it’s unacceptable to say — especially with this new disease coming in, the pandemic. The new disease coming in, a gift from China. Especially when that happened, and they say, “How can we be putting this…” So they don’t want to talk about the wall anymore. They opposed it. They were strongly opposed to it.  And it was interesting because — you said about the wall — they’d say, “No, no, we don’t need a wall. We can have airplanes flying above. We can have pic- — people taking pictures. We can have drones.” They wanted drones. I say, “What are you going to do? Take pictures of everyone flowing across?” They didn’t want to say. They said, “No, no. Walls — that’s old technology.” No, walls are the greatest technology. They work.  I said — I sort of came up with this; I’m sure somebody did, before — I said there’s two things — because everything changes in the world. They change fast. Change is so fast. You do a computer, and it’s obsolete in two weeks. But two things that have never changed: a wall and a wheel. We’re going to always have wheels, and we’re going to always have walls. And we have the best security wall ever built. And we’ll have it a completed very soon.  And the way you said that was very nice. I appreciated the big difference that it’s made. It’s — it’s really great. Thank you very much. Thank you.  So we’re going to the wall now. And we’re going to see a piece of the wall. We’re not going to be able to cover 500 miles of view, but we’ll be able to cover about 10 yards. But we’ll see a piece of a long — of a long wall that we’re building. And you’ll see — you’ll see what we’re talking about.  We’ll see you over there. Thank you, media. Thank you.   END 12:11 P.M.

They often call for ordinary measures and ordinary people finding ways to do ordinary things when everything around them seems to make ordinariness impossible.\"  Judy Note: All Intel indicated that the RV start date for Tier4b (us, the Internet Group) would be tomorrow Thurs. 2 April.  This RV release was part of a war to defeat the Deep State – which evidently created the Corona Virus as part of their agenda to interfere with the Global Currency Reset (which was taking their money supply away) and reduce the world population.  All timing changes of the RV date up to now have been part of that war against the Cabal and related to the strategic military goal of making us safe post-RV from the rats trying to steal our monies and doing us harm.  Today 1 April President Trump announced a massive War on the Mexican Drug Cartels and positioned over 1,000 troops on land and sea to confront them. Mass Arrest operations in the US were on-going right now, though were not expected to take the Internet or phone service completely down. There could be sporadic rolling outages in regions where Deep State rats were being arrested and where \"dark nodes\" in the internet were being removed (“dark nodes” were used by Deep State agents to spy on us through cell phones, computers and smart appliances).  Overnight on Mon. 30 March from 10pm to midnight local times along the West Coast (CA, WA, TX & Midwest), and East Coast (FL, NC, VA, NY, etc) there was rolling phone and internet black outs to cover Spec Ops and other law enforcement arresting the rats (Deep State criminal cartel leaders and pedophile child and human traffickers).  Be Prepared: Evidently today on 1 April a Sherriff’s department in California received a communiqué from the White House saying that there was a possibility that they could be under Martial Law by Fri. 3 April. The general population would be asked to remain at home, with all but essential businesses closed down for two weeks. They were asking that the population be warned to be prepared. It was not known if that order just pertained to that particular county, the whole state of California, or the entire nation.  Martial Law: Evidently President Trump, the Department of Defense, Alliance and decision-makers felt that there has been enough significant Deep State arrests and containment of Deep State leaders globally under Alliance military and operations in Europe, USA and China that there would be no need to declare Martial Law.  Judy Note: It was interesting to note in relation to the above mass arrests and potential phone and internet blackouts, that today Wed. 1 April in my own state of Utah, the governor appointed a retired general with no public health experience, to temporarily take over Utah's COVID-19 response.  Stock Market: On Wed. 1 April at opening the Stock Market plunged over 800 points in the red, flat lined in the red all day and closed at 973 in the red.  The U.S. Dollar Index (USDX) was the value of a U.S. dollar relative to the value of a basket of currencies. The Market was said to have crashed when the US Dollar Index reached 100. Today Wed. 1 April the Index rushed steadily upward all day toward 100. At this writing it was 99.727. https://www.investing.com/currencies/us-dollar-index-streaming-chart  NESARA: According to Fleming Mortgage debt forgiveness and student loans forgiveness was happening now as part of NESARA. There were 100 different types of loans being forgiven now, with the interest paid out now being paid back. According to Bruce, NESARA started Mon. 30 March when there were a number of mortgages forgiven. As of Tues. 31 March morning the mortgage debt forgiveness applied to 23,000 mortgages. MarkZ heard that many home foreclosures had been stopped. That debt forgiveness program would continue and be completed by the end of April. On Student Loans you could call and have them suspended and they would not accrue any more debt.  Stimulus Checks: As part of the release of monies to all Tiers, the bulk of Stimulus checks and direct deposits payments from the US Treasury were scheduled to go out by direct bank deposit tomorrow Thurs. 2 April. According to Bruce and Fleming on Mon. 30 March 638,000 Stimulus checks have already gone out. If you did not receive a direct deposit Stimulus check and you were a US citizen, you could go to a US Treasury site to set up your account and receive your monies. According to Bruce, the Stimulus Checks would not be just for two months, but were a precursor to a Universal Basic Income for US citizens.   Recent GCR History:  Fri. 27 March: The fiat US Dollar became gold-backed, the privately owned Federal Reserve integrated into the new US Treasury owned by The People, new currency rates of 209 sovereign nations were locked into bank screens and the Powers That Be began releasing liquidity for the Global Currency Reset.  Sun. 29 March: After paying out certain Tier 3 groups and making some arrests the Department of Defense released the RV from their control.  Mon. 30 March President Trump signed the final paperwork and Tier 3 began being paid.  Tues. 31 March was the World Court mandated RV start date. The Admiral completed conversion of fiat USD to gold-backed USN process that was started last week in order to make sure that transactions processed in the QFS under the USN. The rest of Tier 3 was said to be paid out after which the intermediates were paid out.  Wed. 1 April Groups in Reno were told they would be liquid.  Thurs. 2 April was the deadline for Tier 4b (us, the Internet Group) to be notified on how to set our redemption appointments.  Wed. 15 April currencies could no longer be exchanged at the Contract rates, Zim no longer redeemed, while the general public could exchange foreign currencies at banks and receive the new international rates.  For the latest news see Q’s George News: https://george.news/#/  A﻿. April 1 2020 Afternoon Fleming Update: Our Military Contact Verified that:  1. We needed to get ready.  2. As Bruce stated we were in the midst of the 48 hours leading to Tier 4a,b start (that ended Thurs. 2 April at 10 am EDT).  3. As Bruce said a total of 638,000 Stimulus checks have been cut by the US Treasury. The IRS started sending them out on Mon. 30 March, and would continue to send them out.  4. Starting today Wed. 1 April or tomorrow Thurs. 2 April the US Treasury/IRS would be starting the direct deposit Stimulus payments.  5. Mortgage debt forgiveness and student loans forgiveness was happening now as part of NESARA. There were 100 different types of loans being forgiven now, with the interest being paid back.  6. The Mass Arrest operations would not take the Internet or phone service completely down, but there could be sporadic rolling outages in regions where Deep State rats were being arrested and where \"dark nodes\" in the internet were being removed (“dark nodes” were used by Deep State agents to spy on us through cell phones, computers and smart appliances).  7. He said what Corey Goode said in David Wilcock's Sun 29 March Youtube video was true that phone and internet communications would not be going down entirely.  8. The virus was the Cabal's last ditch effort, though may be the perfect screen to do the arrests. The military units had been planning to do these arrests for years. They have been training in warehouses how to get in and out and how to get the people out alive and safely. They don't want to kill people. They want these people to be on trial. This was not a mass murder. This was arrests and apparently there's nothing that these [Deep State] guys could to do run.  9. He said Tier 4 a,b start was still at an any moment and has not changed.  10. Last night Tues. 31 March the phone call between Trump and Hong Kong went well, though he couldn’t reveal the details.  11. The Mon 6 April start date for Tire 4 was disinformation.  12. Having said the start was still imminent, he said that like it or not, this RV release was part of a war to defeat the Deep State, all changes in timing that happened till now have been part of the war and have been related to the strategic military goal of making us safe post-RV from the rats trying to steal our monies and harming us and our families.  13. We needed to remain patient and look at the big picture.  14. He said that my other military contact's Intel was accurate in that Tier 4a,b notifications were still imminent.  15. He said that the claim was ludicrous (and misinfo from obstructionists) that Tier 4a,b currency holders going out and spending money would \"cause more danger and make things worse as far as the virus is concerned.\" He said that was exactly what Trump, the Department of Defense, Elders and decision-makers wanted to happen to kick start the economy again during and after the pandemic quarantine.  16. He said politicians cannot stop Tier 4b (us, the Internet Group) now and opposition from Pelosi, Schumer and other Deep State politicians on that level was being bypassed as many of them were subject to their sealed indictments being unsealed and executed through arrest.  17. Many rats were running scared now, and that was a good thing for all, he said.  18. He said that it was irrelevant what the banks wanted or did not want. The banks would send out the 800#s emails when Trump, the Department of Defense, Elders, and the US Treasury gave the green light.  19. The banks would comply on the pain of being arrested by Interpol and domestic law enforcement, because this was an issue of national security and the world needed the release.  20. He said that swabbing at the Redemption Centers would not be mandatory for currency-holders but they would hand you a mask and ask you to use it.  21. He confirmed the Covid-19 was a man-made weaponized virus that was developed by Bill Gates and supported Deep State labs, including the bio-weapon labs at Ft Detrick MD.  22. The Covid-19 virus was developed for the Deep State by Dr. Charles Lieber of Harvard University and his Chinese research aides. Dr. Lieber was arrested by the Department of Justice on 28 Jan. 2020.  23. The Covid-19 virus was smuggled into the Wuhan lab, where it was combined with 5G microwave radiation to increase Covid-19 symptoms, thus killing thousands of Chinese.  24. He said the same thing happened in Italy, Iran and NYC, etc.  25. He said that the virus was real, highly contagious but the death rate (without 5G radiation help) was like normal flu death rate of less than 1%.  26. He recommended that at our appointments we practice cautions, social distancing and respect the concerns of others for protection, especially exchange personnel at the Redemption Centers.

B. April 1 2020 12:56 am EDT Fleming Intel: \"Military Contact\" - Nick V Fleming Intel Update 3-31-20  Our military Intel contact confirmed:  1. The last country has been processed for final release through the Quantum Financial System.  2. Liquidity Releases started Tues. 31 March pending Trump & decision-makers finalizing things Tues. night.  3. Tier4a was expected to start Wed. 1 April, with Tier4b notification started at the same time, or immediately (hours) after Tier4a.  4. Trump, the Elders, Department of Defense and all other decision makers were in the process of working through how to roll this out. Trump's speech on Tues. 31 March at 6:30 pm EDT may have had veiled announcements signaling victory over the Deep State rats.  5. Trump met with HK banks at 8 pm EDT Tues. 31 March to make decisions on how everything would proceed.  6. On Tues. 31 March the Admiral completed conversion of fiat USD to gold-backed USN process that was started last week in order to make sure that transactions processed in the QFS under the USN.  7. After the Admiral's inner and outer core groups (about 226 Tier 3 and Tier 4a groups) were processed, the way was cleared for all T4a groups (total of about 356 groups including the inner and outer core groups) to start being processed.  8. All Tiers would have full liquidity when Tier 4b (us, the Internet Group) were started.  9. Wed. 1 April was looking good for that timing (of Tier 4b liquidity release), though the Admiral could not specify Tier 4b timing for security/sensitivity reasons.  10. There were 1,200 Stimulus checks mailed out through USPS to some citizens.  11. As part of the release of monies to all Tiers the bulk of Stimulus checks and direct deposits payments from the US Treasury were scheduled to go out the week of Mon. 6 April.  12. Overnight on Mon. 30 March from 10pm to midnight local times along the West Coast (CA, WA, TX & Midwest), and East Coast (FL, NC, VA, NY, etc) there was rolling phone and internet black outs to cover Spec Ops and other law enforcement arresting the rats (Deep State criminal cartel leaders and pedophile child and human traffickers).  13. See for last 24 hours the outage spikes from about 10pm to midnight local times: https://downdetector.com/status/t-mobile/ and https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/ and https://downdetector.com/status/att/ and https://downdetector.com/status/sprint/ ).  14. Phone and Internet blackouts would be rolling on and off in different regions to cover the arrests not yet in a nationwide 24-hour phone-Internet blackout.  15. Redemption Centers have CDC and Homeland Security representatives in place now to enforce CDC health measures to protect exchange personnel and currency holders from Covid-19 viral infection during our redemption appts.  16. Tier 4b (us, the Internet Group) would start any time in the next 24 hours.  17. The first appointments would be for 20-25 min. each.  18. For security purposes the goal was to have three redemption appointments per hour.  19. Zim holders especially should count on a second appointment to examine the need for higher Zim rates for their projects.  20. The second appointment would be safe. The currency-holder's health and the health of your assigned Wealth Manager and private banking team has been safeguarded with the CDC measures in place.  21.

One was on Hillary’s Secret Server.  The other regarded an allegation that Hillary turned the State Department into her personal slush fund.  One of the allegations regarding that slush fund was that when Hillary was Secretary of State she granted permission to a Canadian to buy shares of a Uranium mine in Utah, who then sold the shares to Putin, and then the Canadian contributed 80% of his profits to the Clinton Foundation.

Jay Sekulow ACLJ Chief Counsel Take Action  G. Judy Note on Currency Exchange/Bond Redemption: Treat the below as my guess. Official instructions would be available upon RV liquidity release.  An hour or so prior to liquidity release, Wells Fargo and HSBC Banks would send out over 400,000 emails to currency and bond holders, along with instructions on how to exchange and redeem. That information would also be available on certain websites as below:  Each country had their own 800# or website code for use of currency exchangers/bond redeemers that would be sent out by email, or found on the above websites. Clicking on that link on your computer or phone, would create your own unique signature to receive an exchange/ redemption appointment, along with exchange/ redemption information. If there were travel restrictions in your area you could obtain a travel document from a certain website made known with release of the 800#s.  The Tier4b Internet Group (us) could receive the 800#s via receipt of emails containing a code to call for an appointment and a link to a 15 min. CD instruction video that explained the exchange and redemption process.  The Tier4b Internet Group has the opportunity to exchange foreign currencies/ redeem Zim Bonds at higher Contract Rates prior to release to the public. Public exchange was now expected by Wed. 15 April. On that Wed. 15 April currencies would exchange at international rates as shown on the Forex, while Zim Bonds could no longer be redeemed unless prior arrangements had been made.  Special Redemption Centers have been set up across the globe to exchange at Contract Rates from 7am to 11pm. At your twenty minute exchange appointment you would watch an instruction video while they did a background check to flag felons convicted of serious crimes such as drugs and trafficking in order to screen out Cabal criminals from exchanging.  They would have black lights to check currencies and to neutralize viruses on currency notes, before verifying them through a De La Rue machine. They were asking people to keep currency notes safe and clean and to put and keep them in denominational order.  Rates would be high and we would be pleased with all ZIM & currency rates. If you were a Zim holder with currencies to exchange there would be no Contract Rates offered to you. You could only ask for Contract Rates if you held currencies and no Zim.  The Zim was a bond, not a currency, and redemption monies from that bond were designated for humanitarian needs, although a certain percentage would be retained for personal use.  Whether you held currencies or Zim, in order to receive the higher Contract Rates you were encouraged to have a specific humanitarian project typed up in a summary of 1-2 pages that showed approximate costs, time frame of your project (5-10-20 years) how many people you could employ and your background as to what qualified you to do the project.  It was my understanding that if you partnered with other humanitarian projects including CARTS, that connection would not necessarily qualify you for the higher rates unless you had your own humanitarian project to present at your redemption/ exchange appointment.  At the first appointment you would have 5-8 min. to describe your project plan 5-8 min. to tell them about your project. Hand them copies of your Business Plan.  Be prepared to accept the rate offered at that time. If you tried to ask for higher rate beyond what was offered, you ran the risk of appearing to be greedy. If the exchange bankers perceived you as greedy, and/or if you were belligerent and non-cooperative, they would reduce the Zim Rate offered.  Even the lowest Zim rate offered at the first appointment would give you more money than you would ever need to do your projects and wanted for your family for generations. Zim redemptions would yield almost too much money in the world post RV.  You would be scheduled a second appointment with your Wealth Manager within 24-48 hours. At that second appointment you could ask for a higher Zim Rate if you felt you could justify it in your project. As representatives of the US Treasury, the Wealth Manager and Private Banking Team would let you know if in accordance with your project plans, your projects qualified for a higher Zim Rate. If so, the WM & team working for you would negotiate with the US Treasury to obtain that higher rate.  Your Wealth Manager was working for you, would not be telling you what to do with your monies, though would help you comply with your Non Disclosure Agreement and banking regulations. They would treat you with respect as a high level client. It would wise to treat them the same and not demand anything, or you risked being escorted out the door and not allowed to exchange.  All Zim would be on a structured payout (unless you were a senior). You would receive an annual percentage rate on your Zim in the structured payout of what was said to be 5% -7 ½ %. The interest paid was said dependent upon on how much you had and length of your payout period. The longer the payout period, the higher the interest rate likely received. Taxes on your exchange and interest earned were dependent upon the country in which you resided. For US citizens: under present US Tax law you would be taxed on your interest earned.  Seniors age 60 and above had their choice of being paid out or not being paid out their Zim redemption monies in a Structured Annuity Investment Payout. All other Zim redeemers would be paid in a Structured Annuity Investment Payout with your choice of quarterly or annual payouts of 5, 10, 15, 20, or if you asked, 50 or 100 years.  Currency and Zim holders would be offered opportunities to invest in international humanitarian projects. The Chinese-Zimbabwe Humanitarian Project Contracts paid interest on monies invested, and then returned the monies after the term of your contract ended so it could be reinvested in other international humanitarian projects. It was rumored that particular contract was limited in the amount of Zim they could take in so if interested, it would be wise to obtain your exchange/ redemption appointment early.  All exchangers and redeemers would be required to sign a Non Disclosure Agreement that would last for 90 day. After those 90 days there would be another three months you would be tracked on what you said about your NDA. That tracking would happen through your phone conversations, email, Internet and social media. If you said or did anything against your NDA they would come after you and likely freeze your accounts.  If you don’t have a Trust Account for your exchange/redemption, a Treasury Direct Account would be set up at your exchange for your funds. You would have 90 days to set up and transfer those monies into your own Trust Account. Abbot Downing Wealth Managers would be represented at each Redemption Center, though you could choose another Wealth Management company if you wished.  After your appointment you would be closely monitored by the NSA – through your phone, computer and/or Internet. If you broke your NDA and talked about your exchange, you would automatically lose your monies. That NDA would be for a specific time period depending on the amount you received at your exchange/redemption. Most NDAs were said to be valid for only a few months.  H.

Such perpetrator-followers of Satan were organized from the US Inc’s CIA, Queen Elizabeth’s, Vatican’s Ninth Circle Child Sacrifice Cult on down to the Clintons, Hollywood and Pizzagate and local teenage covens.

Name (also include name you’d prefer to be called):   Angie Philips   Political Party:   Democrat  Current or most recent profession:   Community Organizer  Tell us a little about yourself:  I am originally from Grant, Nebraska and moved to Eastern Nebraska in my early 20s. I currently reside in Omaha with my husband and our three children. I studied behavioral science at Bellevue University and worked in case management with struggling families. I currently reside in Omaha with my husband Bill and our three children. I began staying at home after our youngest child was born and became involved in community organizing and human rights advocacy. This led me to founding the Douglas County Democratic Party Women’s Caucus and the Nebraska Progressive Legislative Study Group.  Why are you running for this office?  I am running to give everyday Nebraskans representation in our federal government and to push forward policy that uplifts both our rural and urban communities.  Do you support the actions taken by federal, state and local government officials to combat the spread of COVID-19? What, if any, changes would you propose?  The federal government responded too slowly to the COVID 19 Pandemic. The state government should immediately expand Medicaid and the Governor should enact a stay home order. I support increased testing and guaranteed treatment. Further expansion of PTO, FMLA, and unemployment. Providing zero interest loans and emergency funds for small and micro businesses; direct payments to households for the duration of the crisis; holds on rent and mortgages; and increased funding to house the houseless. Overcrowded prisons should release nonviolent offenders and consider early release where possible. Detention centers should immediately release migrants being detained on civil charges. A fourth wave of legislation is needed to address people impacted by the pandemic who were missed in the first 3 rounds of legislation and a large stimulus package and preventative measures will need to be developed once the crisis is over.  What is your message to Nebraskans during this time of crisis?  As we work to slow the spread of COVID 19 we face many unknowns. One thing we do know is that this virus crosses party lines and so does the solution. We have amazing grassroots, local, and state leadership working tirelessly to ensure our communities can access their basic needs. We must stand together, protect one another, and be kind to one another. Once the pandemic is over we must take measures to prevent, contain, and treat infectious disease outbreaks and protect ourselves from economic damages.  How will you support the economy now and after social distancing requirements end?  I am currently supporting the people in the economy by connecting people in need to community services and resources. I am doing my best to support the economy at an individual level by supporting small local businesses whenever possible during this time which I will continue to do once social distancing requirements end.  What other issues facing voters are most important to you as a candidate?  Climate Change: We must take swift action to reduce the effects of climate change. The United States should re-enter the Paris Climate Agreement as well as work to surpass those goals. We must end our reliance on fossil fuels and move toward 100% clean energy by decarbonizing electricity, vehicles, and buildings. Nebraska can lead the way in carbon sequestration with regenerative agriculture. Regenerative organic agriculture could remove more than 100% of the current CO2 emissions while building soil health, maintaining crop yield, increasing crop resilience, and improving profitability. Regenerative organic agriculture also increases water absorption and reduces runoff and the release of toxins into our water supplies. We must also work to end and correct environmental injustices placed on marginalized communities including Native people who have been disproportionately impacted by companies that place profits over the preservation of Native lands and sacred sites.  Humane Immigration Reform: Our current immigration system is broken and inhumane. The system has been further strained by President Trump's harmful executive orders and policies. Millions of migrants, including children, are being detained in unsanitary and overcrowded detention centers. The Remain in Mexico order has endangered the lives of thousands. Seeking asylum is legal and migrants being detained on civil charges should be released immediately as well as end all forms of family separation. ICE has proven to be a corrupt agency and should be abolished. We should return the handling of immigration services back to Immigration and Naturalization Services and implement more efficient ways to address human and drug trafficking. DACA and TPS recipients should have an immediate path to citizenship and there should be an immediate end to the Trump administration's Muslim ban. We also must address climate change as part of the solution to immigration as it will continue to contribute to the displacement of migrants.  Healthcare: We are facing a national healthcare crisis. We must act responsibly to address the healthcare crisis we face as a nation. I support a healthcare system such as Medicare for All that utilizes cost containment proposals including a single-payer system, budgets for hospitals and medical institutions, a fee schedule for doctors, and limits on drug prices.  Rural Revitalization and Addressing Economic Disparities: I have proposed a plan that will revitalize our rural communities by investing in small business, protecting and expanding postal services, improving infrastructure, education, and work readiness programs, and uplifting our farmers and ranchers while building partnerships between rural and urban areas. I would also proposal plans to uplift communities like North Omaha that have faced over a century of economic oppression and neglect.  Why do you consider yourself the best person to address the needs of Nebraska voters?  Having been born and raised in rural Nebraska and establishing my life in the city, I have a unique understanding of the needs of both rural and urban communities and an understanding of how we are inherently connected. I will advocate for the needs and rights of every Nebraskan so we can build a Nebraska for everyone.  What separates you from your primary challenger(s)? What about your potential general election challengers?  I believe my connection with both urban and rural and eastern and western Nebraska separate me from my primary challengers. I can connect with voters in a unique way that extends across party lines and political affiliations.  In contrast to Senator Sasse, I am interested in representing all Nebraskans, not just towing a party line. Senator Sasse has failed to communicate with his constituents. One can not represent people they do not speak with and communities they won’t step foot in. In order to ensure open communication with constituents, as Senator I am committed to the following:  1) I will open up an office in North Platte, Nebraska to help fill the gap between Kearney and Scottsbluff.  2) I will host regular monthly townhalls. In person when possible and via virtual conferencing when I’m in DC.  3) I will rotate days at my Nebraska offices and make times when I’ll be available in those offices public so constituents don’t feel like they have to hunt me down.  4) My staff will be informed on where I stand on issues and important votes so when you call my office you’ll get more than “thanks, I’ll relay the message”.  5) I will ensure my scheduler doesn’t blow people off. If an in person meeting is requested, meetings with constituents will take priority over meetings with corporate lobbyists. If for some reason I’m not available for an in person meeting, we’ll do a virtual conference.  Is there any other message, statement or concern you’d like to address?  I’d like to encourage Nebraskans to vote by mail. Voting by mail is the best way to vote during the Pandemic in order to ensure safety for ourselves and our communities.

Republicans spent the better part of three nights in their convention presenting softer and gentler sides of President Trump, but the president gets the final words and he came out Thursday in a fighting mood.  His acceptance speech detailed his successes and offered promises aplenty for a second term, but the emphasis and energy were committed to a scorched-earth attack on Joe Biden and the Democrats. Trump threw so many punches at his opponent that, had it been a real heavyweight boxing match, the referee would have stopped it in the middle rounds out of mercy.  Some samples: “This election will decide whether we save the American Dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny.”  Then later: “How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?”  After saying Biden had buckled to the demands of the socialists in his party, Trump asked: “If he can’t stand up to them, how is he going to stand up for you.”  Many of the lines echoed Ronald Reagan, and the two men share key traits, perhaps the most important being a willingness to take on Washington from the inside without ever losing their outsider’s perspective. If there was any doubt, Thursday night settled the question of whether four years in the White House have warmed Trump’s heart to the Beltway.  No, no, a thousand times no.  Instead, he detailed numerous examples of where he believed he was fighting the entire establishment to get things done for the American people, including standing up against China’s theft of jobs and intellectual property and stopping illegal immigration. In his mind, he is often a lonely warrior.  While Reagan’s folksy charm belied a core of steely conviction, Trump generally prefers to dispense with the niceties and get down to business.  And make no mistake: Thursday’s speech was all business. He came not to debate Joe Biden, but to bury him.  On the merits, it was an effective argument on every front, from the economy to foreign policy to law and order. The routine was for Trump to cite his own first-term accomplishments as more than Biden had done in his 47 years in Washington.  The only question was whether the pounding was too brutal for those swing voters in the swing states the president is courting.  Some are disaffected Trump supporters and some are undecideds, often because, polls show, they don’t approve of the president’s bull-in-a-china-shop conduct.  The issue is so important that Ivanka Trump, in introducing her father, casually noted that his communications “are not to everyone’s tastes,” and added that his tweets can feel “unfiltered.” Of course, the acknowledgment was aimed at giving people permission to support the president despite their misgivings.  Moreover, the campaign long ago learned that Trump will be Trump and made its bet that the public will put results over any qualms about style, taste and personality.  And while the speech on the White House lawn had a rally feel about it, the attacks on Biden were substantive and policy-based.  While Democrats want the election to be about the president’s handling of the virus, another key issue has emerged that could prove more decisive. The riots, looting and crime surges in the nation’s cities have become a political flashpoint.  One reason is that nearly all the cities are run by Democratic mayors. Another is that Biden and the party didn’t say a single word about the destruction at their convention, instead embracing Black Lives Matter and treating the protesters as new-age heroes.  Trump and the GOP have been jumping on the error ever since, and it became a major focus of the convention. The president cited it numerous times last night as another disqualifying action, or inaction, by his opponent.  Already, the polls have started to reflect public unease with the chaos, and while Dems had hoped they could use it as a reason to turn the tide against the president, they seem to realize they made a serious miscalculation.  Biden has spoken out twice in recent days about the violence, a clear sign that he sees the danger. Still, his words have been more pleading than the president’s, who is eager to send in federal troops if local governments and police can’t gain control of the streets.  The spreading violence is scaring Americans everywhere, with the situation in Kenosha, Wis., perhaps more frightening than what’s been happening in Portland, Seattle and elsewhere.  Kenosha is a city of only 100,000 people, and the violence there is all the more shocking than what is happening in much larger cities. In effect, Kenosha is something of an Everytown, and the riots, arson and murder could cause more people to identify with it and wonder if their town is next.  The issue is undercutting a key feature of the Dems’ plan. They used their convention to portray Biden as empathic, someone who feels the pains of others because he has suffered enormous personal tragedies.  But Trump is trying to recast that quality as a weakness, saying that Biden is not tough enough to combat the current wave of lawlessness.  In effect, the Trump team is asking: Who would you rather have on your side in a street fight — a tough puncher like Trump, or a guy like a Biden who feels the opponent’s pain?  Before the conventions, Biden had a significant lead in most polls.  It’s likely the race has tightened, but this is a heavyweight match with many more rounds to go.

(NEXSTAR)  AUSTIN (KXAN) — When the Supreme Court issued its decision saying the Trump Administration illegally stopped the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program Thursday, it sent shockwaves across the American political landscape.  The high court reversed the administration’s closing of the program, 5-4.  Generally speaking, Democrats are cheering the high court’s decision to restore protections to DACA recipients, better known as Dreamers, and Republicans were left stymied.  “Today’s victory for DREAMers is a victory for us all,” Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said. “DREAMers are our doctors, nurses, brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, neighbors and members of the military. DREAMers are here to stay.”  The rest of the Democrats’ statement via Hinojosa is as follows:  It is fiercely American to look out and protect one another. Our DREAMers have always deserved the same protections as anybody else and now they will get those protections they deserve. We applaud the Supreme Court for making the right decision. Diversity is America’s greatest strength. The United States is a nation built by immigrants. DREAMers embody American values and contribute to the strength and resilience of the United States every single day. The Texas Democratic Party is proud to stand strongly and in solidarity with the DREAMers and immigrant youth here in Texas and across the country. Everybody deserves to live without fear and nobody should ever be forced to live in the shadows Gilberto Hinojosa, Texas Democrats  KXAN has reached out to the Texas GOP for a statement, and when we receive it, we’ll update this story.  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, issued this statement on the decision:  We are disappointed with today’s SCOTUS decision, but it does not resolve the underlying issue that President Obama’s original executive order exceeded his constitutional authority. We look forward to continuing litigating that issue in our case now pending in the Southern District of Texas Ken Paxton, Texas Attorney General  Texas AFL-CIO President Rick Levy and Secretary-Treasurer Montserrat Garibay said in a statement while the Dreamers won, it’s just a “temporary reprieve.”  “Congress still needs to pass comprehensive immigration reform that gives Dreamers and other immigrants a path to citizenship. To accomplish that goal, the people must speak,” the statement said.  “The Texas AFL-CIO will continue to stand with our DACAmented members to battle for justice for immigrant communities. How the next steps play out will be determined by how all of us continue to organize and how voters join together at the polls in the most important election of our lives.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 5, "positive": 31, "negative": 1, "joy": 3, "anger": 10, "surprise": 2, "fear": 4, "trust": 2}, "metadata": ["rally", "supreme", "sued", "trump", "austin", "deferred", "arrivals", "american", "democrats", "daca", "victory", "texas", "diversity", "united", "values", "solidarity", "gop", "pending", "southern", "district", "comprehensive", "immigration", "election"]}, {"text": "TOPEKA, Kan. – The passing of Monday's deadline to file to run for Kansas' open Senate seat confirmed that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo won't be a candidate, and a major anti-abortion group threw its support behind Rep. Roger Marshall to keep immigration hardliner Kris Kobach from the GOP nomination.  Republican leaders had not expected Pompeo to give up his post as the nation's top diplomat to seek the seat being vacated by retiring four-term Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. Yet until the noon filing deadline, he remained the top choice for U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other GOP leaders who saw him as close to a sure thing for keeping the seat in Republican hands.  The passing of the filing deadline without an appearance by Pompeo in the state capital — or a form signed by him and witnessed by a Kansas resident appearing in the mail — snuffed out the last dying embers of speculation. It also left Marshall and Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state who lost the 2018 governor's race, as the top rivals in a GOP field of 11 candidates.  “Considering the fact that Kris Kobach managed to lose a gubernatorial election in a deep red state, it understandably creates anxiety among Republicans if he were to be the Republican nominee,” said Whit Ayres, a GOP pollster.  Marshall’s campaign has received a boost in recent days from key anti-abortion endorsements, including one Monday from the National Right to Life Committee.  “Their support in this race sends a clear message to pro-life voters: Our campaign is in the strongest position to keep the seat in pro-life hands,” Marshall said in a statement.  Many Republicans fear that Kobach's nomination would put the seat in play even though Republicans have won every Senate election in Kansas since 1932. They see a possible repeat of 2018, when Kobach emerged from a crowded primary for governor and alienated independent and moderate Republican voters in the general election campaign. Kansas has no runoff, so it's possible for a candidate to win in such a crowded field with 30% or less of the vote.  Kobach has maintained that he'd win a Senate race in the fall because Trump voters will turn out in greater numbers. He said GOP voters know he strongly opposes abortion and dismissed the nervousness among some top Republicans about him.  “The establishment wants a senator that they can control,” Kobach said. “The establishment wants to compromise.”  The GOP is spooked because the presumed Democratic nominee, Kansas City-area state Sen. Barbara Bollier, a former moderate Republican, raised nearly $3.5 million for her campaign by the end of March, more than any other candidate so far.  Republicans have a 53-47 Senate majority. But GOP incumbents face tough reelection races in states including Arizona, Colorado, Maine, North Carolina and perhaps elsewhere, giving Democrats a legitimate shot at taking over.  “Adding another state to the map, a state where you wouldn’t otherwise be spending in, is not a positive position to be in,” said Scott Jennings, a GOP strategist and a long-time political adviser to McConnell.  Marshall's endorsement by the National Right to Life Committee came just after he received a coveted endorsement from Kansans for Life, the state's most influential anti-abortion group and long a key player in state GOP politics. The national group said Marshall, an obstetrician, had an “exemplary” record on abortion issues and has the best chance of defeating Bollier, who strongly supports abortion rights.  Top national Republicans have been watching Marshall’s performance and have expressed disappointment that he did not do a better job of fundraising and clearing rivals out of the field to reduce a division of the anti-Kobach vote in the Aug. 4 primary. Marshall raised $2.1 million by the end of March, much of it from his House campaign fund.  But Marshall pollster Robert Blizzard said Marshall’s fundraising will improve with Pompeo officially out of the race.  “Imagine trying to raise money this past year when there’s been at least a couple of hundred stories about Mike Pompeo, will he or won’t he,” Blizzard said.  Marshall faces plans for $2.2 million in television ads attacking him by the national anti-tax, free-market group Club for Growth. Marshall won his congressional seat in 2016 after unseating conservative tea party favorite Rep. Tim Huelskamp in the GOP primary and has been painted by some on the right as a moderate, despite a conservative voting record and vocal loyalty to President Donald Trump.  And Bob Hamilton, the founder of a Kansas City-area plumbing company, continued last week to launch new television ads in a bid some Republicans are watching to see whether it gains traction.  Kobach, too, has picked up anti-abortion endorsements, including last week from Operation Rescue, which focuses more on trying to shut down abortion clinics than enacting legal restrictions. He also was Trump's earliest prominent Kansas supporter in 2016 and has continued as an informal adviser.   ___   Fram reported from Washington.   ___  Follow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 12, "positive": 29, "negative": 5, "disgust": 6, "joy": 3, "anger": 8, "surprise": 2, "fear": 2, "trust": 8}, "metadata": ["deadline", "senate", "immigration", "gop", "republican", "leader", "resident", "election", "campaign", "kobach's", "trump", "abortion", "carolina", "democrats", "legitimate", "state's", "ads", "attacking", "conservative", "vocal", "donald", "___"]}, {"text": "PHOENIX — Two U.S. citizens were arrested Wednesday night in southern Arizona for attempting to smuggle drugs inside their bodies, U.S Customs and Border Protection announced in a press release.

She’s an arrogant elitist who thinks that anyone who doesn’t agree with her is a xenophobic, misogynistic, racist, lowlife.  And that’s if you’re on her good side.  In an appearance on Seth Meyers, AOC didn’t disappoint. She told the host, “We’re all going to get mailed a prompt to fill out the census in the next two weeks or so. Every single person, no matter your documentation status, no matter your housing status, income, etc., is to be counted.”  Numbers from the census are used to determine how much in goodies offered by the government should be dispersed to certain states and areas. AOC’s belief is “the more the merrier.” Presumably, she would deny our household pets the opportunity to be counted — but then she’s an animal rights nutcase so…who knows?  It’s OK to fill out the form if you’re an illegal because we made sure there wouldn’t be any bothersome question on whether you’re a citizen or not. That simple measure was removed before the forms were printed after pro-illegal alien groups sued to have it taken out.   Why?  In 2019, Ocasio-Cortez condemned the idea of a citizenship question on the census, saying, “unspeakable horrors have been executed in the United States in the name of citizenship.”  I’m not sure what “unspeakable horrors” she’s referring to. Maybe she thinks arresting someone for breaking the law against entering the country illegally is a “horror.” Whatever she’s talking about, we’ll never know because the horrors are unspeakable.   How convenient.  President Trump stoked outrage in 2018 when his administration announced plans to reintroduce a citizenship question to the decennial U.S. census for the first time since 1950. Critics called the proposed citizenship question xenophobic and claimed its addition would suppress a true count of the populace, but proponents argued the measure would protect against voting discrimination. Federal Judge Jesse Furman ruled against the plan, writing that the implementation of a citizenship test would be both “arbitrary and capricious.”  Well, he’s a federal judge so any law he doesn’t much like is “arbitrary and capricious.”  Of course, illegals don’t understand that immigration authorities can’t use census data to carry out that round-up they’re always being told is planned for them. Therefore, their fear of identifying themselves for automatic deportation as non-citizens is just stupid paranoia.  Ocasio-Cortez makes her living by scaring the most vulnerable among us and using that fear to gain political power.

If China’s opposition to the move isn’t heard, some “corresponding measures” will come into play.  PM Boris Johnson said earlier on Wednesday that if China pursues hotly-debated national security laws in Hong Kong, millions of its residents will be eligible for the British National Overseas (BNO) passport.  The passport currently allows holders to enter the UK without a visa for six months, but British immigration laws could be changed in such a way that overseas nationals would be able to stay in the UK for a renewable period of 12 months – and become British citizens in the future.  On Thursday, Chinese diplomats hit back at the PM’s promise, saying it was an affront to its sovereignty and a breach of London’s own agreements with Beijing. The UK had once declared that “it will not confer the right of abode to Chinese citizens in Hong Kong who hold BNO passports,” China’s Embassy in London recalled.  If Hong Kongers are allowed to emigrate en masse, it would breach the UK’s “own position and pledges as well as international law and basic norms governing international relations,” it added.  We firmly oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures.  Ambassador Liu Xiaoming noted that nothing in the joint Sino-British declaration returning Hong Kong to China gives the UK “sovereignty, jurisdiction or right of supervision” over the former colony.  Echoing countless statements by Chinese officials, he said Hong Kong affairs fall within China’s jurisdiction and “brook no external interference.”  “Gone are the days when Hong Kong was under British colonial rule,” he tweeted.  Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab acknowledged that there’s little the UK can do “to force China to allow BNOs to come to the UK.” Still, London will use “diplomatic leverage” to persuade Beijing against enacting the Hong Kong security laws.

The protests saw clashes with police who used water cannon, tear gas, and pepper spray against the crowds.  The protestors believe the legislation – which outlaws secession, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces – will silence dissent and spell the end of Hong Kong’s special autonomous status. Beijing insists that it’s only looking to boost security and ensure stability in the region; and it has consistently demanded that nations backing pro-independence protests stop meddling in China’s internal affairs.

Rather than going after Mark Morgan for battling every day to keep everyday Americans free, safe, and prosperous, his critics should pay more attention to the significant accomplishments made under his tenure to deliver better borders for all of us.  Morgan is the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. That would be the 60,000 men and women who every day monitor and guard our borders so that goods and services and legitimate travelers cross as speedily as possible, while stopping the criminals and smugglers, who are harmful and dangerous to all of us.  Morgan’s entire professional life has been dedicated to selfless service. He started in the Marine Corps and served in the FBI before coming to the Department Homeland Security, of which CBP is a part. His credentials are top of the line, and he’s a proven and responsible leader. Under his tenure, the border has been better secured.  Nothing in Morgan’s track record and performance in office, however, has stopped him from being unfairly targeted and criticized.  When the possibility of amnesty for illegal immigrants came up in the presidential debate, it highlighted that even the promise of amnesty complicates securing the border.  Human traffickers would use the possibility of amnesty as a massive advertising tool. They will try to flood the border, not just with a new wave of illegal migration, but also to open opportunities for smuggling fentanyl and other dangerous drugs.  This administration rejects amnesty, as it should, sparking endless criticism from the left. Morgan also defended the administration’s policy of ending “catch and release.”  The end of “catch and release” serves as a powerful deterrent against illegal border crossing. Morgan tweeted that resuming it would trigger an “invasion.”  One representative running for reelection immediately accused him of “racism.”  According to one report, Twitter briefly suspended Morgan’s account for violating its standard of “hateful conduct,” but didn’t block the representative’s account for making a false, pejorative, and hateful claim.  Securing the border is anything but racist or hateful conduct.  Everyone suffers when the cartels and transnational gangs run wild on the U.S.-Mexico border. Those violent, brutal criminal enterprises employ “coyotes” to run human smuggling and illegal crossings at the border, using the profits to finance their other criminal activities, including smuggling of drugs and guns, prostitution, and money laundering.  The greatest victims are the migrants themselves, who are at risk of rape, assault, disease, exposure, extortion, human slavery, and death. Knowing the loopholes in our immigration system, smugglers traffic children to help fraudulent family units easily enter the U.S.  American communities are also victimized by the many crimes that attend transnational criminal activities, from car theft to gang violence.  It’s disturbing to see members of Congress go after the messenger, rather than work with the administration to address the problem.  Censoring government officials who are trying to enforce the law and ensure public safety is also deeply troubling.  When social media platforms take such actions, warns The Heritage Foundation’s technology expert, Klon Kitchen, they are rightly “viewed as biased and untrustworthy.”  Much has been done over the past four years to build a better border, and Morgan has been a key factor in that success.  Americans should be working together to build on that legacy, not degrade the effort with calumnies.  This article has been modified to clarify that Twitter briefly suspended Mark Morgan’s account.

The writer, who is the author of Le Grand Remplacement (The Great Replacement), was charged with “public incitement to hate or violence on the basis of origin, ethnicity, nationality, race or religion.”  The conviction stems from a November 2017 speech in Colombey-les-deux Eglises to the National Council of European Resistance in which Camus declared, “Immigration has become an invasion.”  “The irreversible colonization is demographic colonization, by the replacement of the population,” said the author, adding, “The ethnic substitution, the great replacement, is the most important event in the history of our nation since it has existed; as with other people, if the story continues, it will not be that of France.”  Camus also called for a “national consensus of resistance” to oppose Islamization in “the struggle for the salvation of our common civilization, Celtic, Slavic, Germanic, Greek-Latin, Judeo-Christian.”  The part of Camus’ speech that specifically garnered the attention of judges was when he talked about European people being replaced.  Camus said mass immigration “is the substitution, the tendency to substitute everything with its emulator, normalized, standardized, interchangeable: The original with its copy, the authentic with its imitation, the true with the false, the mothers with surrogate mothers, the culture with free time and entertainment.”  France suffers Islamic terror attacks on such a routine basis that it’s barely even an important news story anymore.

In an interview published in the Wall Street Journal, Yale University’s Frank Snowden — a historian who most recently in 2006 published a book about Italy’s eradication of malaria — details how the coronavirus pandemic is threatening the globalist worldview of free movement of people and free trade.  The interview finds the Journal‘s Jason Willick seemingly admits the coronavirus is tainting globalism and pushing Americans and the peoples of Europe toward nationhood:  Yet while the [bubonic] plague saw power move up from villages and city-states to national capitals, the coronavirus is encouraging a devolution of authority from supranational units to the nation-state. This is most obvious in the European Union, where member states are setting their own responses. Open borders within the EU have been closed, and some countries have restricted export of medical supplies. The virus has heightened tensions between the U.S. and China, as Beijing tries to protect its image and Americans worry about access to medical supply chains. [Emphasis added]  Snowden told the Journal the coronavirus is a direct result of the globalization of the American economy after nearly four decades of free trade policy initiatives:  The coronavirus is threatening “the economic and political sinews of globalization, and causing them to unravel to a certain degree,” Mr. Snowden says. He notes that “coronavirus is emphatically a disease of globalization.” The virus is striking hardest in cities that are “densely populated and linked by rapid air travel, by movements of tourists, of refugees, all kinds of business people, all kinds of interlocking networks.” [Emphasis added]  Globalization, Snowden notes, has driven the coronavirus to majorly impact the wealthiest of Americans.  “Respiratory viruses, Mr. Snowden says, tend to be socially indiscriminate in whom they infect. Yet because of its origins in the vectors of globalization, the coronavirus appears to have affected the elite in a high-profile way,” the Journal piece states. “From Tom Hanks to Boris Johnson, people who travel frequently or are in touch with travelers have been among the first to get infected.”  The infection of thousands of the nation’s rich and upper-middle-class has driven class warfare in regions like the Hamptons in New York where some of the wealthiest, most liberal celebrities own property.  A report by Maureen Callahan for the New York Post chronicles how the working class staff of the Hamptons’ elite are turning on them as those infected disregard rules and Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines:  “There’s not a vegetable to be found in this town right now,” says one resident of Springs, a working-class pocket of East Hampton. “It’s these elitist people who think they don’t have to follow the rules.” [Emphasis added] It’s not just the drastic food shortage out here. Every aspect of life, most crucially medical care, is under strain from the sudden influx of rich Manhattanites panic-fleeing … — and in some cases, knowingly bringing coronavirus. [Emphasis added] … “We’re at the end of Long Island, the tip, and waves of people are bringing this s–t,” says lifelong Montauker James Katsipis. “We should blow up the bridges. Don’t let them in.” [Emphasis added]  While globalization has delivered soaring profits for corporate executives, working- and middle-class American communities have been left behind to grapple with fewer jobs, less industry, stagnant wages, and increase competition in the labor market due to decades-long mass legal immigration.  Since 2001, free trade with China has cost millions of Americans their jobs. For example, the Economic Policy Institute has found that from 2001 to 2015, about 3.4 million U.S. jobs were lost due to the nation’s trade deficit with China.  Of the 3.4 million U.S. jobs lost in that time period, about 2.6 million were lost in the manufacturing industry, making up about three-fourths of the loss of jobs from the U.S.-Chinese trade deficit.

Full text of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's DNC speech:  WILMINGTON, Del. -- Joe Biden vowed to unite an America torn by crisis and contempt Thursday night, accepting the Democratic presidential nomination in an unfinished personal quest that has spanned three decades and been marred by personal tragedy, political stumbles and more dynamic rivals.The past hurdles fell away as Biden addressed his fellow Democrats and millions of Americans at home who he hopes will send him to the White House to replace Donald Trump - though his triumphant moment was drained of immediate drama by the coronavirus pandemic, which left him speaking to a nearly empty arena rather than a to a joyously cheering crowd.\"Here and now I give you my word, if you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us not the worst,\" Biden declared. \"I'll be an ally of the light, not our darkness.\"\"And make no mistake, united we can and will overcome this season of darkness in America.\"Fireworks lit the sky outside as the convention ended, giving a celebratory feel at last to the affair.In his acceptance speech, Biden highlighted both his world view and a series of deeply personal challenges that shaped his life. On issues big and small, the 77-year-old Democrat presented a sharp contrast to the Republican president, but maintained a hopeful tone throughout.His critics often lament his ability to speak under pressure, but with the nation watching, Biden did not stumble.The pandemic has shaken the nation and fundamentally altered the campaign. But Biden pointed to the public health emergency and the severe economic fallout to turn traits previously seen as vulnerabilities, notably a long career spent in elected office, into an advantage by presenting himself as a competent leader in a moment that Democrats say cries out for one in the White House.The night's keynote address was the speech of a lifetime for Biden, who would be the oldest president ever elected if he defeats Trump in November. But his convention leaned on a younger generation earlier in the night to help energize his sprawling coalition.Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois senator who lost both legs in Iraq and is raising two young children, said Biden has \"common decency.\"Cory Booker, only the ninth African American senator in U.S. history, said Biden believes in the dignity of all working Americans.And Pete Buttigieg, a 38-year-old openly gay military veteran from Indiana, noted that Biden came out in favor of same-sex marriage as vice president even before President Barack Obama did.\"Joe Biden is right, this is a contest for the soul of the nation. And to me that contest is not between good Americans and evil Americans,\" Buttigieg said. \"It's the struggle to call out what is good for every American.\"Above all, Biden focused on uniting the nation as Americans grapple with the long and fearful health crisis, the related economic devastation, a national awakening on racial justice - and Trump, who stirs heated emotions from all sides.Biden's positive focus Thursday night marked a break from the dire warnings offered by former President Obama and others the night before. The 44th president of the United States warned that American democracy itself could falter if Trump is reelected, while Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris, the 55-year-old California senator and the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, addressed race problems in a way Biden could not.Throughout their convention, the Democrats summoned a collective urgency about the dangers of Trump as president. In 2016, they dismissed and sometimes trivialized him. In the days leading up to Biden's acceptance speech, they cast him as an existential threat to the country.Beyond Biden's highly anticipated speech, Thursday's program was designed to highlight the diversity of the Democratic Party and the nation he hopes to lead.\"We know how important it is that we elect real leaders like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, people of honor and integrity, who hold justice close to their hearts and believe that the lives of my four Black children matter,\" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said. She spoke ahead of a tribute to the late John Lewis, the Georgia congressman and civil rights leader who devoted much of his life to ensuring African Americans are able to vote.Biden's Democratic Party has sought this week to put forward a cohesive vision of values and policy priorities, highlighting efforts to combat climate change, tighten gun laws and embrace a humane immigration policy. They have drawn a sharp contrast with Trump's policies and personality, portraying him as cruel, self-centered and woefully unprepared to manage virtually any of the nation's mounting crises and policy challenges.Voting was a prime focus of the convention on Thursday as it has been all week. Democrats fear that the pandemic -- and the Trump administration -- may make it difficult for voters to cast ballots in person or by mail.Comedian Sarah Cooper, a favorite of many Democrats for her videos lip syncing Trump's speeches, put it bluntly: \"Donald Trump doesn't want any of us to vote because he knows he can't win fair and square.\"Biden's call for unity comes as some strategists worry that Democrats cannot retake the White House simply by tearing Trump down; Biden needs to give his sprawling coalition something to vote for. That's easier said than done in a modern Democratic Party made up of disparate factions that span generation, race and ideology.Though he has been in the public spotlight for decades, much of the electorate knows little about Biden's background before he began serving as President Barack Obama's vice president in 2008.Thursday's convention served as a national reintroduction of sorts that drew on some of the most painful moments of his life.\"I know how mean and cruel and unfair life can be sometimes,\" Biden said. He added: \"I found the best way through pain and loss and grief is to find purpose.\"As a schoolboy, Biden was mocked by classmates and a nun for a severe stutter. He became a widower at just 30 after losing his wife and infant daughter to a car accident. And just five years ago, he buried his eldest son who was stricken by cancer.From such hardship, Biden developed a deep sense of empathy that has defined much of his political career. And throughout the convention, Biden's allies testified that such empathy, backed by decades of governing experience, makes him the perfect candidate to guide the nation back from mounting health and economic crises.His allies Thursday included Brayden Harrington, a 13-year-old boy from Concord, New Hampshire, who talked about the bond he shares with Biden over stuttering.The boy said he and Biden were \"members of the same club,\" each with a stutter they're working to overcome. He noted that Biden told him about a book of poems he liked to read aloud to practice his speech and showed the boy how he marks his speeches so they're easier to read aloud.\"I'm just a regular kid, and in a short amount of time, Joe Biden made me more confident about a thing that's bothered me my whole life,\" Harrington said.The pandemic forced Biden's team to abandon the typical convention pageantry and rely instead on a highly-produced, all-virtual affair that has failed to draw the same television ratings as past conventions. The silence was noticeable Thursday night as Biden took the stage to make history in a cavernous hall in downtown Wilmington. His audience consisted of a few dozen reporters and photographers.It's Trump's turn next. The Republican president, who abandoned plans to host his convention in North Carolina and in Florida, is expected to break tradition and accept his nomination from the White House lawn next week.In the meantime, he's seeking to take attention from Biden. Trump was continuing this week's swing-state tour on Thursday with a stop near Biden's birthplace of Scranton, Pennsylvani a. While he is trying to stay on offense, the president has faced a series distractions of his own this week, many of his own making.Trump on Wednesday praised a conspiracy-theory group that believes the president's political opponents support satanism and pedophilia. On Thursday, a federal judge ruled that prosecutors could access his long-hidden tax returns. Also Thursday, New York prosecutors announced the indictment of Steve Bannon, Trump's former campaign manager and White House chief counsel, who was charged with fraud.Good evening.Ella Baker, a giant of the civil rights movement, left us with this wisdom: Give people light and they will find a way.Give people light.Those are words for our time.The current president has cloaked America in darkness for much too long. Too much anger. Too much fear. Too much division.Here and now, I give you my word: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us not the worst. I will be an ally of the light not of the darkness.It's time for us, for We the People, to come together.For make no mistake. United we can, and will, overcome this season of darkness in America. We will choose hope over fear, facts over fiction, fairness over privilege.I am a proud Democrat and I will be proud to carry the banner of our party into the general election. So, it is with great honor and humility that I accept this nomination for President of the United States of America.But while I will be a Democratic candidate, I will be an American president. I will work as hard for those who didn't support me as I will for those who did.That's the job of a president. To represent all of us, not just our base or our party. This is not a partisan moment. This must be an American moment.It's a moment that calls for hope and light and love. Hope for our futures, light to see our way forward, and love for one another.America isn't just a collection of clashing interests of Red States or Blue States.We're so much bigger than that.We're so much better than that.Nearly a century ago, Franklin Roosevelt pledged a New Deal in a time of massive unemployment, uncertainty, and fear.Stricken by disease, stricken by a virus, FDR insisted that he would recover and prevail and he believed America could as well.And he did.And so can we.This campaign isn't just about winning votes.It's about winning the heart, and yes, the soul of America.Winning it for the generous among us, not the selfish. Winning it for the workers who keep this country going, not just the privileged few at the top. Winning it for those communities who have known the injustice of the \"knee on the neck\". For all the young people who have known only an America of rising inequity and shrinking opportunity.They deserve to experience America's promise in full.No generation ever knows what history will ask of it. All we can ever know is whether we'll be ready when that moment arrives.And now history has delivered us to one of the most difficult moments America has ever faced.Four historic crises. All at the same time. A perfect storm.The worst pandemic in over 100 years. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.The most compelling call for racial justice since the 60's. And the undeniable realities and accelerating threats of climate change.So, the question for us is simple: Are we ready?I believe we are.We must be.All elections are important. But we know in our bones this one is more consequential.America is at an inflection point. A time of real peril, but of extraordinary possibilities.We can choose the path of becoming angrier, less hopeful, and more divided.A path of shadow and suspicion.Or we can choose a different path, and together, take this chance to heal, to be reborn, to unite. A path of hope and light.This is a life-changing election that will determine America's future for a very long time.Character is on the ballot. Compassion is on the ballot. Decency, science, democracy.They are all on the ballot.Who we are as a nation. What we stand for. And, most importantly, who we want to be.That's all on the ballot.And the choice could not be clearer.No rhetoric is needed.Just judge this president on the facts.5 million Americans infected with COVID-19.More than 170,000 Americans have died.By far the worst performance of any nation on Earth.More than 50 million people have filed for unemployment this year.More than 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance this year.Nearly one in 6 small businesses have closed this year.If this president is re-elected we know what will happen.Cases and deaths will remain far too high.More mom and pop businesses will close their doors for good.Working families will struggle to get by, and yet, the wealthiest one percent will get tens of billions of dollars in new tax breaks.And the assault on the Affordable Care Act will continue until its destroyed, taking insurance away from more than 20 million people - including more than 15 million people on Medicaid - and getting rid of the protections that President Obama and I passed for people who suffer from a pre-existing condition.And speaking of President Obama, a man I was honored to serve alongside for 8 years as Vice President. Let me take this moment to say something we don't say nearly enough.Thank you, Mr. President. You were a great president. A president our children could - and did - look up to.No one will say that about the current occupant of the office.What we know about this president is if he's given four more years he will be what he's been the last four years.A president who takes no responsibility, refuses to lead, blames others, cozies up to dictators, and fans the flames of hate and division.He will wake up every day believing the job is all about him. Never about you.Is that the America you want for you, your family, your children?I see a different America.One that is generous and strong.Selfless and humble.It's an America we can rebuild together.As president, the first step I will take will be to get control of the virus that's ruined so many lives.Because I understand something this president doesn't.We will never get our economy back on track, we will never get our kids safely back to school, we will never have our lives back, until we deal with this virus.The tragedy of where we are today is it didn't have to be this bad.Just look around.It's not this bad in Canada. Or Europe. Or Japan. Or almost anywhere else in the world.The President keeps telling us the virus is going to disappear. He keeps waiting for a miracle. Well, I have news for him, no miracle is coming.We lead the world in confirmed cases. We lead the world in deaths.Our economy is in tatters, with Black, Latino, Asian American, and Native American communities bearing the brunt of it.And after all this time, the president still does not have a plan.Well, I do.If I'm president on day one we'll implement the national strategy I've been laying out since March.We'll develop and deploy rapid tests with results available immediately.We'll make the medical supplies and protective equipment our country needs. And we'll make them here in America. So we will never again be at the mercy of China and other foreign countries in order to protect our own people.We'll make sure our schools have the resources they need to be open, safe, and effective.We'll put the politics aside and take the muzzle off our experts so the public gets the information they need and deserve. The honest, unvarnished truth. They can deal with that.We'll have a national mandate to wear a mask-not as a burden, but to protect each other.It's a patriotic duty.In short, I will do what we should have done from the very beginning.Our current president has failed in his most basic duty to this nation.He failed to protect us.He failed to protect America.And, my fellow Americans, that is unforgivable.As president, I will make you this promise: I will protect America. I will defend us from every attack. Seen. And unseen. Always. Without exception. Every time.Look, I understand it's hard to have hope right now.On this summer night, let me take a moment to speak to those of you who have lost the most.I know how it feels to lose someone you love. I know that deep black hole that opens up in your chest. That you feel your whole being is sucked into it. I know how mean and cruel and unfair life can be sometimes.But I've learned two things.First, your loved ones may have left this Earth but they never leave your heart. They will always be with you.And second, I found the best way through pain and loss and grief is to find purpose.As God's children each of us have a purpose in our lives.And we have a great purpose as a nation: To open the doors of opportunity to all Americans. To save our democracy. To be a light to the world once again.To finally live up to and make real the words written in the sacred documents that founded this nation that all men and women are created equal. Endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. Among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.You know, my Dad was an honorable, decent man.He got knocked down a few times pretty hard, but always got up.He worked hard and built a great middle-class life for our family.He used to say, \"Joey, I don't expect the government to solve my problems, but I expect it to understand them.\"And then he would say: \"Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in your community. It's about looking your kids in the eye and say, honey, it's going to be okay.\"I've never forgotten those lessons.That's why my economic plan is all about jobs, dignity, respect, and community. Together, we can, and we will, rebuild our economy. And when we do, we'll not only build it back, we'll build it back better.With modern roads, bridges, highways, broadband, ports and airports as a new foundation for economic growth. With pipes that transport clean water to every community. With 5 million new manufacturing and technology jobs so the future is made in America.With a health care system that lowers premiums, deductibles, and drug prices by building on the Affordable Care Act he's trying to rip away.With an education system that trains our people for the best jobs of the 21st century, where cost doesn't prevent young people from going to college, and student debt doesn't crush them when they get out.With child care and elder care that make it possible for parents to go to work and for the elderly to stay in their homes with dignity. With an immigration system that powers our economy and reflects our values. With newly empowered labor unions. With equal pay for women. With rising wages you can raise a family on. Yes, we're going to do more than praise our essential workers. We're finally going to pay them.We can, and we will, deal with climate change. It's not only a crisis, it's an enormous opportunity. An opportunity for America to lead the world in clean energy and create millions of new good-paying jobs in the process.And we can pay for these investments by ending loopholes and the president's $1.3 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest 1 percent and the biggest, most profitable corporations, some of which pay no tax at all.Because we don't need a tax code that rewards wealth more than it rewards work. I'm not looking to punish anyone. Far from it. But it's long past time the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations in this country paid their fair share.For our seniors, Social Security is a sacred obligation, a sacred promise made. The current president is threatening to break that promise. He's proposing to eliminate the tax that pays for almost half of Social Security without any way of making up for that lost revenue.I will not let it happen. If I'm your president, we're going to protect Social Security and Medicare. You have my word.One of the most powerful voices we hear in the country today is from our young people. They're speaking to the inequity and injustice that has grown up in America. Economic injustice. Racial injustice. Environmental injustice.I hear their voices and if you listen, you can hear them too. And whether it's the existential threat posed by climate change, the daily fear of being gunned down in school, or the inability to get started in their first job - it will be the work of the next president to restore the promise of America to everyone.I won't have to do it alone. Because I will have a great Vice President at my side. Senator Kamala Harris. She is a powerful voice for this nation. Her story is the American story. She knows about all the obstacles thrown in the way of so many in our country. Women, Black women, Black Americans, South Asian Americans, immigrants, the left-out and left-behind.But she's overcome every obstacle she's ever faced. No one's been tougher on the big banks or the gun lobby. No one's been tougher in calling out this current administration for its extremism, its failure to follow the law, and its failure to simply tell the truth.Kamala and I both draw strength from our families. For Kamala, it's Doug and their families.For me, it's Jill and ours.No man deserves one great love in his life. But I've known two. After losing my first wife in a car accident, Jill came into my life and put our family back together.She's an educator. A mom. A military Mom. And an unstoppable force. If she puts her mind to it, just get out of the way. Because she's going to get it done. She was a great Second Lady and she will make a great First Lady for this nation, she loves this country so much.And I will have the strength that can only come from family. Hunter, Ashley and all our grandchildren, my brothers, my sister. They give me courage and lift me up.And while he is no longer with us, Beau inspires me every day.Beau served our nation in uniform. A decorated Iraq war veteran.So I take very personally the profound responsibility of serving as Commander in Chief.I will be a president who will stand with our allies and friends. I will make it clear to our adversaries the days of cozying up to dictators are over.Under President Biden, America will not turn a blind eye to Russian bounties on the heads of American soldiers. Nor will I put up with foreign interference in our most sacred democratic exercise - voting.I will stand always for our values of human rights and dignity. And I will work in common purpose for a more secure, peaceful, and prosperous world.History has thrust one more urgent task on us. Will we be the generation that finally wipes the stain of racism from our national character?I believe we're up to it.I believe we're ready.Just a week ago yesterday was the third anniversary of the events in Charlottesville.Remember seeing those neo-Nazis and Klansmen and white supremacists coming out of the fields with lighted torches? Veins bulging? Spewing the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the '30s?Remember the violent clash that ensued between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it?Remember what the president said?There were quote, \"very fine people on both sides.\"It was a wake-up call for us as a country.And for me, a call to action. At that moment, I knew I'd have to run. My father taught us that silence was complicity. And I could not remain silent or complicit.At the time, I said we were in a battle for the soul of this nation.And we are.One of the most important conversations I've had this entire campaign is with someone who is too young to vote.I met with six-year old Gianna Floyd, a day before her Daddy George Floyd was laid to rest.She is incredibly brave.I'll never forget.When I leaned down to speak with her, she looked into my eyes and said \"Daddy, changed the world.\"Her words burrowed deep into my heart.Maybe George Floyd's murder was the breaking point.Maybe John Lewis' passing the inspiration.However it has come to be, America is ready to in John's words, to lay down \"the heavy burdens of hate at last\" and to do the hard work of rooting out our systemic racism.America's history tells us that it has been in our darkest moments that we've made our greatest progress. That we've found the light. And in this dark moment, I believe we are poised to make great progress again. That we can find the light once more.I have always believed you can define America in one word: Possibilities.That in America, everyone, and I mean everyone, should be given the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them.We can never lose that. In times as challenging as these, I believe there is only one way forward. As a united America. United in our pursuit of a more perfect Union. United in our dreams of a better future for us and for our children. United in our determination to make the coming years bright.Are we ready?I believe we are.This is a great nation.And we are a good and decent people.This is the United States of America.And there has never been anything we've been unable to accomplish when we've done it together.The Irish poet Seamus Heaney once wrote:\"History says,Don't hope on this side of the grave,But then, once in a lifetimeThe longed-for tidal waveOf justice can rise up,And hope and history rhyme\"This is our moment to make hope and history rhyme.With passion and purpose, let us begin - you and I together, one nation, under God - united in our love for America and united in our love for each other.For love is more powerful than hate.Hope is more powerful than fear.Light is more powerful than dark.This is our moment.This is our mission.May history be able to say that the end of this chapter of American darkness began here tonight as love and hope and light joined in the battle for the soul of the nation.And this is a battle that we, together, will win.I promise you.Thank you.And may God bless you.And may God protect our troops.

Follow him on Twitter @TheAntiPCProf  Why do giant corporations and billionaires fund Black Lives Matter and Antifa, both avowed socialist groups? And why do the leftists accept their aid? They both want a kind of socialism, but only one of them could get their way.  If you’re at all familiar with the corporate and billionaire funding sources behind Black Lives Matter and Antifa and the socialist commitments of these groups and their leaders, you’ve probably wondered why the ‘capitalist class’ would support a movement whose doctrine is apparently antithetical to their own interests. Aren’t these funders capitalists after all, and don’t capitalists naturally oppose socialism?  And why do American leftists dance like marionettes attached to strings pulled by globalist billionaires? Don’t they understand that they’re actually serving the masters they claim to oppose?  The answer is not so simple as the World Socialist Website suggests: “The aims of the Black Lives Matter movement are aligned with those of Wall Street and the US government.” Nor is the answer that BLM/Antifa have merely ‘sold out’ to capitalists. Nor is the donor class making a mistake, or merely interested in racial equality. The answer is that the corporate and billionaire elites prefer a kind of socialism – namely, ‘corporate socialism’.   Corporate socialism  And what is corporate socialism? Corporate socialism is not merely government bailouts for corporations. It is a two-tiered system of ‘actually-existing socialism’ on the ground, paralleled by a set of corporate monopolies on top. (‘Actually-existing socialism’ is a pejorative term used mostly by dissidents in socialist countries to refer to what life was really like under socialism, rather than in the perfidious books of Marx and his epigones.)  Wealth for the few, ‘economic equality’ under reduced conditions for the many – corporate socialism is a form of neo-feudalism.  In Wall Street and FDR, historian Anthony C Sutton described corporate socialism, as developed in the 19thth century, and distinguished it from state socialism, as follows: “[The] robber baron schema is also, under different labels, the socialist plan. The difference between a corporate state monopoly and a socialist state monopoly is essentially only the identity of the group controlling the power structure. The essence of socialism is monopoly control by the state using hired planners and academic sponges. On the other hand, Rockefeller, Morgan, and their corporate friends aimed to acquire and control their monopoly and to maximize its profits through influence in the state political apparatus; this, while it still needs hired planners and academic sponges, is a discreet and far more subtle process than outright state ownership under socialism…We call this phenomenon of corporate legal monopoly – market control acquired by using political influence – by the name of corporate socialism.”   Read more  What Sutton calls corporate socialism might otherwise be called ‘corporate-run socialism’ or ‘socialist capitalism’.  For both state socialists and corporate socialists, the free market is the enemy. They both seek to eliminate it. The free market threatens the system of state control in the case of state socialism. In the case of corporate socialism, the free market represents an impediment to the unhampered accumulation of wealth. The corporate socialists do not mean to eliminate profit. Quite to the contrary, they mean to increase it and keep it all to themselves.  To ensure and appreciate profits to the fullest, corporate socialists seek to eliminate competition and the free market. As Sutton wrote, for the 19th-century corporate socialists: “The only sure road to the acquisition of massive wealth was monopoly: drive out your competitors, reduce competition, eliminate laissez-faire, and above all get state protection for your industry through compliant politicians and government regulation.”  The difference between state socialism and corporate-run socialism, then, is merely that a different set of monopolists are in control. Under state socialism, the monopoly is held by the state. Under corporate socialism, the monopolists are giant corporations. But both political economies are characterized by monopoly.  And both systems use socialist-communist ideology – or the recent incarnations, ‘social justice’ or ‘woke’ ideology – to advance their agendas. For corporate socialists, corporate monopoly is the desired end and socialist ideology is among the means.  Socialist ideology works to the benefit of corporate socialists because it demonizes competition and the free market in an effort to eliminate them. This explains why capitalist corporations like Amazon and mega-wealthy capitalist donors like George Soros and Tom Steyer actually fund organizations with explicitly socialist agendas, like Black Lives Matter, and why Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and other internet giants apparently favor leftist and even socialist over ‘rightwing’ content and users.  Also on rt.com Woke (predatory) capitalism: Leaked documents show banned ‘diversity training’ at notorious multinational Halliburton  Corporate socialism, the coronavirus lockdowns, and the riots  We can see the corporate socialist plan in action with the Covid-19 lockdowns and the Black Lives Matter/Antifa riots. The draconian lockdown measures employed by Democratic governors and mayors and the destruction perpetrated by the rioters are doing the work that corporate socialists want done. Is it any wonder that corporate elites favor leftist politics? In addition to destabilizing the nation state, leftist politics are helping to destroy small businesses, thus eliminating competitors.  As the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE) points out, the lockdowns and riots have combined to level a one-two punch that is knocking out millions of small businesses – “the backbone of the American economy”– all across America. FEE reported that “…7.5 million small businesses in America are at risk of closing their doors for good. A more recent survey showed that even with federal loans, close to half of all small business owners say they’ll have to shut down for good. The toll has already been severe. In New York alone, stay-at-home orders have forced the permanent closure of more than 100,000 small businesses.”  Moreover, minority-owned businesses are the most at-risk. Even New York Governor Andrew Cuomo agrees: “They are 90 percent of New York's businesses and they're facing the toughest challenges.”  Meanwhile, as FEE also notes, there is no evidence that the lockdowns have done anything to slow the spread of the virus. Likewise, there is no evidence that Black Lives Matter has done anything to help black lives. If anything, the riotous and murderous campaign of Black Lives Matter and Antifa have proven that black lives do not matter to Black Lives Matter. In addition to murdering black people, the Black Lives Matter and Antifa protest riots have done enormous damage to black businesses and neighborhoods, and thus, to black lives.   Read more  As small businesses have been crushed by the combination of draconian lockdowns and riotous lunacy, corporate giants like Amazon have thrived like never before. The two developments ‘just so happen’ to move us closer to corporate-run socialism.  As BBC News noted, at least three of the tech giants – Amazon, Apple, and Facebook – have appreciated massive gains during the lockdowns, gains which were no doubt abetted by riots that cost one to two billion in property damages. During the three months ending with June, Amazon’s “quarterly profit of $5.2bn (£4bn) was the biggest since the company's start in 1994 and came despite heavy spending on protective gear and other measures due to the virus.”  Amazon’s sales rose by 40 percent in the three months ending in June. As reported by TechCrunch, Facebook and its WhatsApp and Instagram platforms saw a 15 percent rise in users, which brought revenues to a grand total of $17.74 billion in the first quarter.  Facebook’s total users climbed to three billion internet users in March, or two-thirds of the world’s internet users, a record. Apple’s revenues soared during the same period, with quarterly earnings rising 11 percent year-on-year to $59.7 billion. “Walmart, the country's largest grocer, said profits rose four percent, to $3.99 billion,” during the first quarter of 2020, as reported by the Washington Post.  These same corporations are also major supporters of Black Lives Matter and affiliated groups. As CNET reported, “Google has committed $12 million, while both Facebook and Amazon are donating $10 million to various groups that fight against racial injustice. Apple is pledging a whopping $100 million for a new Racial Equity and Justice Initiative that will ‘challenge the systemic barriers to opportunity and dignity that exist for communities of color, and particularly for the black community’ according to Apple CEO Tim Cook.”  Is it just a coincidence that the number of small businesses have been nearly cut in half by the Covid-19 lockdowns and the Black Lives Matter/Antifa riots, while the corporate giants have consolidated their grip on the economy, as well as their power over individual expression on the internet and beyond? Or, do the lockdowns and the riots prove that corporate socialism is afoot? And is “woke capitalism” merely a concerted PR campaign for appeasing activists and black people in order to curry favor and avoid cancel culture? Or, does woke capitalism actually express globalist, corporate socialist interests? What would a politics that serves such interests look like?  Also on rt.com Biden distances himself from ‘far-left’ voters, rejects ‘crucial’ Green New Deal & defund the police movement  Corporate socialism and contemporary leftism  To benefit the globalist agenda of corporate socialists, those of monopolies or near monopolies, a political creed would likely promote the free movement of labor across national borders and thus would be internationalist rather than nationalist.  The global corporate monopolies or would-be monopolies would likely benefit from the creation of utterly new identity types for new niche markets, and thus would welcome and encourage gender pluralism, transgenderism and other identity morphisms. The disruption of stable gender identity categories erodes and contributes to the dismantling of the family, or the last bastion of influence between the masses and corporate power.  Ultimately, the global capitalist corporation would benefit from a singular globalized governmental monopoly with one set of laws, and thus would promote a borderless internationalism under a global government, preferably under their complete control, otherwise known as globalism. And the corporate socialists would benefit from the elimination of small businesses.  How does this line up with contemporary leftism? It has the same objectives. Leftism encourages unfettered immigration. It encourages gender pluralism and transgenderism and openly calls for the dissolution of the family. It seeks to destroy historical memory, inherited culture, Christianity, and the nation state. It aims at a one-world monopoly of government. And it despises small business and free enterprise.  Thus, leftist politics align perfectly with the globalist interests of monopolistic corporations. And corporate socialists are the beneficiaries of their ‘activism’.

Are both presidential candidates trying to lose? Or at least pursuing campaign strategies which put them at grave risk of defeat?  In nearly four years, Donald Trump has made little effort to win over the 50 percent-plus of voters who didn't support him in 2016. Having proved that he could win the presidency without a plurality of the popular vote, he has ignored the possibility that he could govern more effectively if he were reelected with an absolute majority.  You can see the results as Trump supporters scan the polling data for encouraging information. They quickly pass over the national polls showing him trailing by 7.7 percent, according to a RealClearPolitics average of recent polls. They focus instead on the chart showing him running slightly better against Joe Biden in the battleground states than he was against Hillary Clinton two to three weeks out in 2016.  If these numbers prove as much off the mark as in 2016, Trump could win a second term with 270-plus electoral votes. But that conclusion requires a lot of assumptions. Past polling hasn't leaned consistently toward one party, and pollsters tend to compensate -- often overcompensate -- for apparent past mistakes.  Astonishingly, Trump has failed to emphasize his two signature 2016 issues: immigration and trade. He can claim that his new trade agreements and economic policies have produced income and wealth gains disproportionately favoring low-wage workers -- something administrations of both parties have failed to achieve for a generation.  And he can argue that his immigration policies -- and the cooperation he has successfully wrested from Mexico -- have prevented the surge of unskilled illegal immigrants which could easily resume the minute the networks call the election for Joe Biden.  Biden has a different strategy, with risks of its own. With a solid lead in the polls, and with COVID-19 providing a rationale for laying low, he's running out the clock. On nearly half the days in September, his staffers announced an early lid. Sometimes, he'd generate no news after 9:00 a.m. He took three days off this week for debate preparation. He and vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris have taken almost no questions from reporters, almost all of whom seem determined not to ask anything that might hurt his chances.  Biden has answered which flavor milkshake he ordered but has refused to say whether he, like many other Democrats, would support packing the Supreme Court. He chewed out the one reporter who asked him about his son Hunter's business deals. Harris, similarly, keeps out of question range. ABC's Jonathan Karl notes that she's taken more questions from the cast of \"The Avengers\" than from the traveling press.  Obviously, the Biden-Harris ticket is deflecting attention away from the radical policies that Biden has endorsed -- and which almost everyone in the press corps favors. After 40 years of opposing government-paid abortions, he now backs them. He's likely to use regulations to reduce fracking, which has reduced gas prices and carbon emissions. His tax increases threaten to stymie economic recovery.  There's one problem with this strategy: If something does rock the boat, it could tip it over. A bad debate performance, a sudden brain freeze or an unanticipated negative story could capsize the campaign. Efforts to help the Biden campaign, such as Twitter's and Facebook's attempts to conceal the New York Post's Hunter Biden story, could boomerang and catch voters' attention.  The Biden campaign is aware of the risks. It quickly rejected the Trump campaign's proposal to reschedule the canceled Oct. 15 debate to Oct. 29. Democrats remember what happened to Jimmy Carter after Ronald Reagan's performance in their one debate just a week before the election.  The fact is that both these septuagenarian candidates are capable of political self-harm. The most successful presidents of the last 100 years -- Franklin Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan -- had no really close friends or confidants. Each believed, as Susan Eisenhower writes of her grandfather in her recent book \"How Ike Led: The Principles Behind Eisenhower's Biggest Decisions,\" \"that the task of overcoming any challenge must be a personal matter -- a burden to be borne alone.\"  Donald Trump and Joe Biden, at least until his basement confinement, have been something like the opposite. They have been willing to share their vagrant and passing thoughts on matters momentous and trivial at great, and sometimes embarrassing, length. The question now is whether Trump can repress that impulse or provoke Biden to indulge it.

If approved, Proposition 16 would repeal a 1996 initiative that made it unlawful for California’s state and local governments to discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to people based on race, ethnicity, national origin or sex. Then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, championed the measure as part of his conservative bid for the presidency.  The California of 2020 is less Republican and more diverse than it was 24 years ago, with Latinos making up 39% of the population in a state where no group holds a majority.  Still, the repeal might not have made the ballot if not for the Memorial Day police killing of George Floyd while handcuffed by police in Minneapolis. Voters’ decision will test support for the Black Lives Matter movement.  Assemblywoman Shirley Weber, a San Diego Democrat and chairwoman of the California Legislative Black Caucus, is the lead author of the legislation that put the question to voters, which required two-thirds support in both houses of the state Legislature.  “I think the death of George Floyd made racism very real for people; they could see it. And now what I was asking them to do was to act on it, stop telling me how horrible it is, stop telling me that you really didn’t know that, stop telling me that this is such a revelation for you,” Weber said.  She added: “Now the question becomes, what are you going to do about it?”  Early voting begins Monday for the Nov. 3 election.  The U.S. Supreme Court has long outlawed racial quotas, but it has ruled that universities may use tailored programs to promote diversity.  Last year, a federal judge in Boston rejected claims that Harvard’s admissions policies discriminated against Asian American applicants to keep their numbers artificially low. The plaintiff, the Students for Fair Admissions group, is appealing.  Supporters of Proposition 16 include U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California, the Democratic nominee for U.S. vice president, Black Lives Matter movement co-founders, professional sports teams and politically liberal groups of all types. They argue that some programs are needed to help level a systemically racist playing field. The campaign has raised $14 million, far more than the $1 million raised by opponents.  Opponents include Ward Connerly, an African American businessman and former University of California regent who pushed for the 1996 ban.  They say government should never discriminate by race or gender, and the only way to stop discrimination is to end it. Joining Connerly are more recent Chinese immigrants who say the United States shouldn’t play favorites based on skin color.  In 2014, activists scuttled an attempt to restore racial preferences in higher education and successfully voted out some Asian American legislators they called traitors to their race.  Assemblyman Evan Low, who is Chinese American, voted in June to put the issue before voters despite emails and phone calls running 37-to-1 against it. He rebuked proponents for failing to reach out to him and the broader Asian American community at a time when all minorities have reason to feel under attack.  “Yes, we have a moral compass, but we must have conversations, difficult ones, even with those communities in opposition, because we’re all in this together, right?” said Low, a Silicon Valley Democrat, in June.  Supporters say minority- and women-owned businesses have missed out on public contracting dollars. Because of the ban, culturally specific programs aimed at improving high school graduation rates for African American boys and Latinas were discontinued, deepening divides.  And while some Asian Americans are admitted to elite universities in large numbers, affirmative action proponents say they too hit a “bamboo ceiling” that prevents them from landing executive-level positions.  On the other side, Tom Campbell, a former dean of the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, said the college recruited minority applicants through strong outreach to high school students in nearby Oakland.  The legacy of slavery and Jim Crow segregation laws exists, he said, but, “I just will not engage in this method of correcting that, because it is wrong to the individual kept out because of her or his race.”  Kali Fontanilla teaches English as a second language in Salinas, California and before that, tutored African American students. She identifies as Black and biracial, and said students of color don’t need their standards lowered.  “That’s insulting to me to say that there’s certain groups that because of the color of your skin you’re not meeting the standard, you can’t meet the standard (so) we’re going to help you, we’re going to give you this crutch to get in,” she said.  Higher education has long been a flash point in the debate and both sides point to admissions statistics at the University of California and its nine undergraduate campuses to make their case.  Opponents of affirmative action say Latinos have made significant progress without preferential treatment, making up 25% of undergraduates last year, double their share two decades ago.  Supporters of affirmative action note that Latinos make up more than half of California’s high school seniors, with a graduation rate above 80 percent.  The population of California has also changed dramatically since 1996. The numbers of Latino and Asian American residents — and voters — have grown, although likely voters are still disproportionately white. Democrats still make up nearly half of registered voters, but the percentage of Republicans in the state has dropped from 36% to 24%.  Dan Schnur, who teaches political communications at UC Berkeley and the University of Southern California, noted that young white Californians also are much more liberal on issues of immigration, same-sex marriage and equity, having “grown up in much more diverse and multicultural environments than their parents and grandparents.”  But recent polls by the Public Policy Institute of California and the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley showed the measure trailing. Last year, voters in Washington narrowly upheld that state’s ban.  Thomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said claims that a quarter of college students are Latino are “not something to be celebrated,” given that more than half of all public school students are Latino.  “That’s a disparity that needs to be aggressively addressed, and Proposition 16 would allow us to do that,” he said.

Communications Minister Saifuddin Abdullah sparked confusion Thursday after saying every film and video, including those produced by media groups and social media users, must comply with a 1981 Film Act that requires licensing. Applicants must also to have a registered company with a 50,000 ringgit ($11,700) paid-up capital.  He was asked about the issue in Parliament after Al-Jazeera refuted claims it needed a license to produce a July 3 news documentary on the treatment of undocumented immigrants. Police have opened an investigation after officials complained the documentary was inaccurate and biased.  Many Malaysians and opposition lawmakers criticized Saifuddin's announcement that could potentially affect videos produced on popular social media platforms such as Tik Tok, Facebook and Instagram. Over 80% of Malaysia's 32 million population are social media users.  The Centre for Independent Journalism has also said the government should counter the Al-Jazeera documentary with facts, instead of using a police investigation and licensing requirement to retaliate against the broadcaster.  Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim said it was an 'alarming development amid attacks and harassment on media including Al-Jazeera' under new Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, who took power in March.  'It is unreasonable and a step backward,' Anwar said in a statement, calling it a move to stifle dissent.  Saifuddin, in a statement late Thursday, clarified that the government 'has never thought of using the act to stifle individual freedom on social media.' He acknowledged the decades-old law was outdated and needs to be fine-tuned, but didn't clear the air over whether it would apply to videos on social media.  Rights activists have already voiced concern over freedom of speech and media independence under the new government. Satellite television provider Astro was recently issued a heavy fine by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission for airing an Al-Jazeera documentary in 2015 over the 2006 murder of a Mongolian woman that allegedly contained 'offensive content.\"  Former Prime Minister Najib Razak, whose long-ruling party was ousted in 2018 polls but made a comeback as part of the new government, was implicated in the murder. He is currently on trial on corruption charges.  Popular online news portal Malaysiakini and its editor face rare contempt proceedings from the attorney-general over comments posted by readers against the judiciary.

The Labour MP described the new law as \"flawed\" but said that she recognized that legislation on immigration was needed. Cooper added the caveat that she would \"put forward amendments\" that she hopes \"will receive cross-party support\".  — BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) May 18, 2020  ​However, 15 Labour MPs signed an amendment to the legislation that they would refuse to give it a second reading because it “contains no provisions to end the hostile environment”.

Home Secretary Priti Patel said the plans would create a “high skill” economy but critics have said that the coronavirus pandemic has shifted public perception over what defines skill.  Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the National Health Service (NHS) and other frontline industries have been highlighted as sectors which rely heavily on immigrant labour.  Labour’s Shadow Home Secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, argued that the salary threshold of £25,600 included in the bill signalled that those earning below the line are “unskilled and unwelcome”.  “Those who clapped [for carers] on Thursday are only too happy to vote through a bill that will send a powerful message to those same people – that they are not considered by this government to be skilled workers,” he said.  “Are shop workers unskilled? Are refuse collectors? Are local government workers? Are NHS staff? Are care workers? Of course they are not”, he added.  Those who wish to work in the country under the new system can be awarded extra points if they have certain qualifications or if there is a shortage in a given industry.  The bill was first introduced in December 2018, but suffered a series of defeats under Theresa May's then-minority government.

MIAMI (AP) — Ten Democrats railed against a national economy and Republican administration they argued exist only for the rich as presidential candidates debated onstage for the first time in the young 2020 season, embracing inequality as a defining theme in their fight to deny President Donald Trump a second term in office.  Health care and immigration, more than any other issues, led the debate. And Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, more than anyone else, stood out — on her own at times — in calling for \"fundamental change\" across the nation's economy and government to address a widening gap between the rich and the middle class.  \"I think of it this way. Who is this economy really working for? It's doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top,\" Warren declared shortly before raising her hand as one of the only Democrats on stage willing to abolish her own private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan. \"Health care is a basic human right, and I will fight for basic human rights.\"  The debate marked a major step forward in the 2020 presidential campaign as Democrats fight to break out from a crowded field that has been consumed by one question above all: Who's best positioned to defeat Trump? The candidates will spend the next eight months before primary voting scrapping over that question and the broader fight for the direction of their political party.  Another 10 candidates, including early front-runner Joe Biden, take their turn debating Thursday night.  While Trump is the ultimate target of many Democratic voters, the president wasn't a major feature for most of Wednesday night. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee was one of the few to go hard after Trump, declaring, \"The biggest threat to the security of the United States is Donald Trump.\"  Instead of Trump, Democrats leaned into the issue that helped deliver the party the House majority last year: Health care. All supported the concept of providing universal health care, but they differed on how they would reach that goal.  Warren and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio backed abolishing private health insurance. Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota favored preserving the private insurance market.  O'Rourke said people who like their health care plans should be able to keep them: \"We preserve choice,\" he said.  The exchange is almost certain to be revived on Thursday when Bernie Sanders is among the candidates who will be on stage. The Vermont senator has proposed a \"Medicare for All\" system without private insurance while Biden, who will also be debating, hasn't gone that far.  Immigration was also on the candidates' minds as they pointed to the searing photos of a drowned Salvadoran father and his toddler daughter at the Rio Grande and blamed Trump and his policies concerning migrants crossing into America illegally.  \"Watching that image of Oscar and his daughter Valeria was heartbreaking,\" said former Obama administration housing chief Julian Castro. \"It should also piss us all off.\"  He also assailed O'Rourke for not calling for fully decriminalizing crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.  \"I just think it's a mistake, Beto,\" he said, adding that O'Rourke would agree with him \"if you did your homework on this issue.\"  O'Rourke says he doesn't support fully decriminalizing such border crossings because of fears about smugglers of drugs and people.  Other than those skirmishes, Democrats waged a largely civil debate with few instances of the type of bitter confrontation that has dominated politics in the Trump era. The candidates — at least for one night — were content to focus on their views of what America is and should be. No one openly stumbled.  Absent the ugly attacks or missteps of debates in past elections, the two-hour discussion allowed the party to show off its extraordinary diversity. Wednesday's lineup featured three women — Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard in addition to Warren and Klobuchar — one black man and another man of Mexican heritage. Three candidates and a moderator spoke Spanish at times, while New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, an African American, talked about the violence that left seven people in his own urban neighborhood shot last week.  At one point, Inslee boasted that he alone among the 10 had signed a bill on reproductive rights for women.  Klobuchar spoke up for the women on stage: \"I just want to say there's three women up here who have fought pretty hard for a woman's right to choose.\"  Warren spent the evening at center stage, a top-tier candidate whose campaign has gained ground in recent weeks as she has released a near-constant stream of policy proposals. She was flanked by several candidates, including O'Rourke and Booker, who needed a breakout moment. That proved elusive on a crowded stage with moderators pressing candidates to stick to strict time limits.  The sober policy discussion underscored a much louder internal fight over how aggressive Democrats should be on the nation's most pressing issues.  On one side: candidates like Warren who are demanding dramatic change that includes embracing liberal policy priorities like free universal health care, debt-free college, a forgiving immigration policy and higher taxes on the rich. On the other: pragmatic-minded Democrats like Biden — and little-known former Maryland Rep. Delaney — who are calling for modest policy solutions that could ultimately attract bipartisan support.  \"We should be the party that keeps what's working and fixes what's broken,\" said Delaney, one of the few Democrats on stage who represented his party's moderate wing. \"Why do we have to stand for taking away something from people?\"  Trump, the elephant not in the room, was in the air traveling to Japan for a round of trade talks as Democrats faced the nation for the first time in the 2020 campaign.

She's calling for an \"intervention\" to save the nation from him. He says she's \"crazy.\"  The enmity between President Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deteriorated Thursday into rude-and-then-some questioning of his fitness for office and her sanity, with personal attacks flowing from both the nation's top elected officials after a dramatic blow-up at the White House.  However intended, the exchanges left uncertain ahead of the 2020 election whether Trump and the Democrats will be able to work together on serious, must-pass tasks, such as funding the government and raising the federal borrowing limit, let alone thornier issues such as immigration, national security and more.  Pelosi went first, with demure shrugs and practiced sass. Then, as a tornado warning blared across Washington, Trump followed with a derisive nickname — something he had declined to give her, up to now.  \"She's a mess,\" Trump told reporters at an afternoon news conference in which he lined up White House staff to testify to his calmness the day before when he walked out after three minutes at a meeting with Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer.  \"Crazy Nancy. ... I watched Nancy and she was all crazy yesterday.\"  As for himself, he declared, \"I'm an extremely stable genius.\"   Pelosi scolded back:  \"When the 'extremely stable genius' starts acting more presidential, I'll be happy to work with him on infrastructure, trade and other issues,\" she tweeted.  There was more, before and after that exchange, for political enthusiasts with the time and interest to follow along.  For those who don't: The theater came a day after Trump stalked out of the Cabinet Room demanding an end to all congressional investigations before he would work with Congress on repairing U.S. infrastructure or other matters. He apparently was wound up generally over the ongoing congressional Trump-Russia probes into whether he obstructed justice, and specifically by Pelosi's jab a few minutes earlier at the Capitol that he \"is engaged in a cover-up.\"  \"I don't do cover-ups,\" fumed Trump, who is fighting subpoenas for testimony by current and former White House officials.  Hanging over the increasingly personal exchanges is a drumbeat among about two dozen Democrats and one Republican to launch impeachment hearings against Trump based on special counsel Robert Mueller's report, which described Trump's efforts to block his federal investigation. Pelosi has resisted that impeachment pressure, preferring a methodical process by which Congress investigates and lays out the facts on the question of obstruction of justice. She says the House is \"not on a path to impeachment,\" but she's been clear this week that an impeachment inquiry is not off the table.  Short of that, she's been happy to give Trump a hard time all year, including questioning his manhood and forcing him to re-open the government without the border wall money he demanded. On Thursday, she said the White House is \"crying out\" for impeachment — the idea being that a vindication by the Republican-controlled Senate would help assure his re-election.  On Thursday, subtlety went by the wayside. Pelosi said Trump has established a pattern of unpredictability, and at one point she even joked about the 25th Amendment, the Constitution's provision laying out the procedure for replacing a president.  \"I wish that his family or his administration or his staff would have an intervention for the good of the country,\" Pelosi said at her weekly news conference, adding that she prays for him and the nation.  \"Maybe he wants to take a leave of absence,\" she said. Asked whether she's concerned about Trump's well-being, she replied, \"I am.\"  Trump denied he wanted the House to formally charge him.  \"I don't think anybody wants to be impeached,\" he said.  Pelosi, the second in line to the presidency, said she thinks Trump's actions Wednesday were part of his skill at distraction. But she also suggested what he does isn't all strategic.  \"Sometimes when we're talking to him he agrees,\" she said, only to change his mind. \"He says he's in charge and he may be.\"  During questions, Pelosi said she thought a reporter had asked about \"statutory\" intervention, the 25th Amendment.  \"That's a good idea,\" she said with a smile. \"I am going to take it up with my caucus. Not that they haven't been thinking about it.\"  She has been insulting Trump since the meeting Wednesday that was supposed to be about bridges and other crumbling infrastructure.  \"For some reason, maybe it was lack of confidence on his part ... he took a pass, and it just makes me wonder why he did that,\" she told reporters back on Capitol Hill. \"In any event I pray for the president of the United States.\"  Trump tweeted back: \"Nancy, thank you so much for your prayers, I know you truly mean it!\"   ___  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 19, "joy": 4, "negative": 11, "disgust": 3, "positive": 15, "anger": 9, "surprise": 11, "fear": 8, "trust": 9}, "metadata": ["calling", "donald", "trump", "election", "democrats", "funding", "declined", "senate", "leader", "congress", "infrastructure", "ongoing", "capitol", "subpoenas", "republican", "impeachment", "hearings", "counsel", "resisted", "forcing", "crumbling", "united", "___"]}, {"text": "FREE now and never miss the top politics stories again.

The row came in April 2018 as President Macron sent a controversial immigration bill through the National Assembly where it gained approval. After 61 hours of debate, the bill passed with 228 votes in favor to 139 against, with 24 abstentions in total. The bill doubled the amount of time undocumented migrants could be detained, shortened asylum application deadlines, and introduced a one-year prison sentence for entering France illegally.   Trending  While the majority of Macron’s party voted for the bill, 14 members abstained and one member, Jean-Michel Clement, voted against the legislation and declared he would be leaving the parliamentary group. He said at the time: \"I am not sure we’re sending to world citizens the universal message that has always been ours. He also warned the immigration bill gave a “great platform” to the Front National, France’s prominent far-right party led by Marine Le Pen. The bill may have built up enough support to pass, but this didn't stop criticism on both sides of the Assembly.  Emmanuel Macron news: Macron's immigration policy was described as dangerous  Emmanuel Macron news: The National Assembly  Herve Saulignac, who is a member of the Socialist Party, was one of the many from left wing parties who voted against the bill, opposing provisions that allowed children to be held in detention for up to 90 days. He said: “Nothing justifies locking up a kid.\" Richard Ferrand, the head of Macron’s parliamentary group, defended the bill, saying it proved “our determination to regulate migration, to promote effective integration, to guarantee the right to asylum, in line with the commitments made by the president of the republic\".

Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again! America's enemies are on the run, America's fortunes are on the rise, and America's future is blazing bright.The years of economic decay are over. The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us. Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige.In just 3 short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back!I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been. Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world — and it is not even close. Our borders are secure. Our families are flourishing. Our values are renewed. Our pride is restored. And for all these reasons, I say to the people of our great country, and to the Members of Congress before me: The State of our Union is stronger than ever before!The vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society — one where every citizen can join in America's unparalleled success, and where every community can take part in America's extraordinary rise.From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the United States economy — slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements. Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American. We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting high our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed.Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs — 5 million more than Government experts projected during the previous administration.The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century.Incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my Administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country. If we had not reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witness to America's great economic success.The unemployment rates for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans have reached the lowest levels in history. African-American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low.African-American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years — and last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added.The veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low.The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low.Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in United States history.A record number of young Americans are now employed.Under the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls. Under my Administration, 7 million Americans have come off of food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare.In 8 years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce. In just 3 years of my Administration, 3.5 million working-age people have joined the workforce.Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage-earners has increased by 47 percent — 3 times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent. After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast — and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay-increase since my election. This is a blue collar boom.Real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded!Since my election, United States stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our Nation's wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible — this, as other countries are not doing well. Consumer confidence has reached amazing new heights.All of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and even 100 percent.Jobs and investment are pouring into 9,000 previously-neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts. In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that have not seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement. This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this. It is all working!Opportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army Veteran Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio. After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, and his family — he was homeless. But then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones. He is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight. Tony: Keep up the great work.Our roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start. This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark Criminal Justice Reform into law. Everybody said that Criminal Justice Reform could not be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done.Thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, by far. With the tremendous progress we have made over the past 3 years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many elements of our country, are at a record high. We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just 3 years ago.Likewise, we are restoring our Nation's manufacturing might, even though predictions were that this could never be done. After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my Administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or built. We have created over half a million new manufacturing jobs. Companies are not leaving; they are coming back. Everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is, indeed, where the action is.One of the single biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal. In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President. Following NAFTA's adoption, our Nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs. Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA — only to do absolutely nothing. But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises. Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law.The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers. It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher degree, but also to a much greater level of fairness and reciprocity. This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America's labor unions.I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the United States of America. For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States, now we have changed that but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we have ever had with China, including with President Xi. They respect what we have done because, quite frankly, they could never believe what they were able to get away with year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying: Enough. Now, we want to rebuild our country, and that is what we are doing.As we restore American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere. That is why my Administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba. We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy. The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro's grip of tyranny will be smashed and broken. Here this evening is a man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó. Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland. All Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom! Socialism destroys nations. But always remember, freedom unifies the soul.To safeguard American Liberty, we have invested a record-breaking $2.2 trillion in the United States Military. We have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rockets, ships, and every other form of military equipment — all made in the United States of America. We are also finally getting our allies to help pay their fair share. I have raised contributions from the other NATO members by more than $400 billion, and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled.And just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a new branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force.In the gallery tonight, we have one of the Space Force's youngest potential recruits: 13-year-old Iain Lanphier, an eighth grader from Arizona. Iain has always dreamed of going to space. He was first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy. He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy, and then, he has his eye on the Space Force. As Iain says, \"most people look up at space, I want to look down on the world.\"Sitting beside Iain tonight is his great hero. Charles McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one century ago. Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen — the first black fighter pilots — and he also happens to be Iain's great-grandfather. After more than 130 combat missions in World War II, he came back to a country still struggling for Civil Rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam. On December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday. A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General. And earlier today, I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office. General McGee: Our Nation salutes you.From the pilgrims to our Founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Americans have always rejected limits on our children's future.Members of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people. The people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country. We must always remember that our job is to put America first!The next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools. To rescue these students, 18 States have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships. The programs are so popular, that tens of thousands of students remain on waiting lists. One of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia. Janiyah's mom Stephanie is a single parent. She would do anything to give her daughter a better future. But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania's Governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice for 50,000 children.Janiyah and Stephanie are in the gallery this evening. But there is more to their story. Janiyah, I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over. I can proudly announce tonight that an Opportunity Scholarship has become available, it is going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice!Now, I call on the Congress to give 1 million American children the same opportunity Janiyah has just received. Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act — because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school.Every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and grow. For this reason, our magnificent First Lady has launched the \"Be Best\" initiative — to advance a safe, healthy, supportive, and drug-free life for the next generation, online, in school, and in our communities. Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America's children.My Administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background. Through our Pledge to American Workers, over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans.My Budget also contains an exciting vision for our Nation's high schools. Tonight, I ask the Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America.To expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our Nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities.A good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high-quality healthcare system on Earth. Before I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just 5 years. I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive. I have also made an ironclad pledge to American families: We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions — that is a guarantee. And we will always protect your Medicare and your Social Security.The American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills. That is why I signed an Executive Order requiring price transparency. Many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year, will be even bigger than healthcare reform. It will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care.But as we work to improve Americans' healthcare, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely. One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million Americans. To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare!Over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our Nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders. These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration. This is what is happening in California and other States — their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money. If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left. But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free Government healthcare for illegal aliens!This will be a tremendous boon to our already very-strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall is being built. We have now completed over 100 miles and will have over 500 miles fully completed by early next year.My Administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before. I was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down.And working together, the Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels. I have been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in the Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done properly. I am calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. Get a bill to my desk, and I will sign it into law without delay.With unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic — drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. Among the States hardest hit, Ohio is down 22 percent, Pennsylvania is down 18 percent, Wisconsin is down 10 percent — and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all.Protecting Americans' health also means fighting infectious diseases. We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the Coronavirus outbreak in China. My Administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.We have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease, Alzheimer's, and those struggling with mental health challenges. And because the Congress funded my request, we are pursuing new cures for childhood cancer, and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of the decade.Almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness. Here tonight is a special man, someone beloved by millions of Americans who just received a Stage 4 advanced cancer diagnosis. This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet. Rush Limbaugh: Thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country. Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our Nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I will now ask the First Lady of the United States to please stand and present you with the honor. Rush, Kathryn, congratulations!As we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs. In 2017, doctors at St. Luke's hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive. Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and weighing less than a pound, Ellie Schneider was born a fighter. Through the skill of her doctors — and the prayers of her parents — little Ellie kept on winning the battle for life. Today, Ellie is a strong, healthy 2-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother Robin in the gallery. Ellie and Robin: We are so glad you are here.Ellie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life. Thanks to modern medical wonders, 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survive. Our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie. That is why I am asking the Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neo-natal research for America's youngest patients. That is also why I am calling upon the Members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies.Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God!As we support America's moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the Federal workforce paid family leave, serving as a model for the rest of the country. Now, I call on the Congress to pass the bipartisan Advancing Support for Working Families Act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across the Nation.Forty million American families have an average $2,200 extra thanks to our child tax credit. I have also overseen historic funding increases for high-quality child care, enabling 17 States to serve more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their waitlists altogether. And I sent the Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high-quality childcare and urge you to act immediately.To protect the environment, days ago, I announced that the United States will join the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together Government and the private sector to plant new trees in America and around the world.We must also rebuild America's infrastructure. I ask you to pass Senator Barrasso's highway bill — to invest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels across our land.I am also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high-speed internet, including rural America.A better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe. That means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level, including our Nation's heroic ICE officers.Last year, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders.Tragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens. In Sanctuary Cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed.Just 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the Sanctuary City of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old woman. The killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New York's sanctuary policies, he was set free. If the city had honored ICE's detainer request, his victim would be alive today.The State of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole State to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants — with catastrophic results.Here is just one tragic example. In December 2018, California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault. But as required by California's Sanctuary Law, local authorities released him.Days later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. He viciously shot one man going about his daily work; he approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and the chest. He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon. He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims. One of the victims of his bloody rampage was a 51-year-old American named Rocky Jones. Rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range, murdering him in cold blood. Rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers who loved him more than anything. One of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight. Jody, would you please stand? Jody, our hearts weep for your loss — and we will not rest until you have justice.Senator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue Sanctuary Cities and States when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly policies. I ask the Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately. The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans — not criminal aliens!In the last 3 years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers — and I have signed 9 pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking, domestically and around the globe.My Administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States.Before I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again. My Administration has ended Catch-and-Release. If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed. We entered into historic cooperation agreements with the Governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May — dropping 8 straight months in a row. And as the wall goes up, drug seizures rise, and border crossings go down.Last year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz. Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants. Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to Deputy Chief of Border Patrol — and he joins us tonight. Chief Ortiz: Please stand — a grateful Nation thanks you and all the heroes of Border Patrol.To build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values.With every action, my Administration is restoring the rule of law and re-asserting the culture of American freedom. Working with Senate Majority Leader McConnell and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new Federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written. This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh.My Administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes the Constitutional right to pray in public schools. In America, we do not punish prayer. We do not tear down crosses. We do not ban symbols of faith. We do not muzzle preachers and pastors. In America, we celebrate faith. We cherish religion. We lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God!Just as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another Constitutional right that is under siege all across our country. So long as I am President I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.In reaffirming our heritage as a free Nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation. Now we must embrace the next frontier, America's manifest destiny in the stars. I am asking the Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts — using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars.My Administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism. Last week, I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the change to realize a better future.Three years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS — the bloodthirsty killer Al Baghdadi — is dead!We are joined this evening by Carl and Marsha Mueller. After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker. Kayla once wrote, \"Some people find God in church. Some people find God in nature. Some people find God in love; I find God in suffering. I've known for some time what my life's work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering.\" In 2013, while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS, and kept as a prisoner of Al-Baghdadi himself. After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, Al-Baghdadi murdered young Kayla. She was just 26 years old.On the night that United States Special Forces Operators ended Al Baghdadi's miserable life, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, received a call in the Situation Room. He was told that the brave men of the elite Special Forces team, that so perfectly carried out the operation, had given their mission a name — \"Task Force 8-14.\" It was a reference to a special day: August 14th — Kayla's birthday. Carl and Marsha, America's warriors never forgot Kayla — and neither will we.Every day, America's men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depths of love that dwells in the human heart.One of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake. On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his 1-year-old son, Gage: \"I will be with you again,\" he wrote to Gage. \"I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sand box, watch you play sports and see you have kids also. I love you son, take care of your mother. I am always with you. Dad.\" On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now 13 years old. To Kelli and Gage: Chris will live in our hearts forever.The terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris's life. Soleimani was the Iranian Regime's most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq. As the world's top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children. He directed the December assault on United States Forces in Iraq, and was actively planning new attacks. That is why, last month, at my direction, the United States Military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever.Our message to the terrorists is clear: You will never escape American justice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life!In recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers. The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, stop spreading terror, death, and destruction, and start working for the good of its own people. Because of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very poorly. We can help them make it very good in a short period of time, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help. We are here. Let's see which road they choose. It is totally up to them.As we defend American lives, we are working to end America's wars in the Middle East.In Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are underway. I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them innocent. It is also not our function to serve other nations as a law enforcement agency. These are warfighters, the best in the world, and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all. We are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home!War places a heavy burden on our Nation's extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and her 2 children — 6-year-old Elliana and 3-year-old Rowan. Amy works full time, and volunteers countless hours helping other military families. For the past 7 months, she has done it all while her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment to the Middle East. Amy's kids have not seen their father's face in many months. Amy, your family's sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and peace — we thank you.But Amy, there is one more thing. Tonight we have a very special surprise. I am thrilled to inform you that your husband is back from deployment. He is here with us tonight and we couldn’t keep him waiting any longer. Welcome home, Sergeant Williams. Thank you very much.As the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes. This is the place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life. This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great Generals, including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur. This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more. This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley. This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo.The American Nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk the face of the Earth. Our ancestors braved the unknown; tamed the wilderness; settled the Wild West; lifted millions from poverty, disease, and hunger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine; laid down the railroads, dug out canals, raised up the skyscrapers — and, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional Republic ever to exist in all of human history. And we are making it greater than ever before!This is our glorious and magnificent inheritance.We are Americans. We are the pioneers. We are the pathfinders. We settled the new world, we built the modern world, and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of Almighty God.America is the place where anything can happen! America is the place where anyone can rise. And here, on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true!This Nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece. We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored. Our brightest discoveries are not yet known. Our most thrilling stories are not yet told. Our grandest journeys are not yet made. The American Age, the American Epic, the American Adventure, has only just begun!Our spirit is still young; the sun is still rising; God's grace is still shining; and my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come!Thank you. God Bless You. God Bless America.

As restrictions, rules and regulations give way to new health and safety protocols, several islands are reopening their borders to travel from the U.S. while others take a wait-and-see approach.  With wildcards in the deck like airlines restoring flights and the hurricane season that continues through the end of November, comebacks are gradual with social distancing, health screening and sanitizing the new normal and face masks as necessary as swimsuits and sunscreen.  “Thus far, the region has effectively minimized the spread of COVID-19, “said Frank Comito, CEO and director general, Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association. “Health and safety protocols are being put in place, mirroring the international standards which have been recommended and adding more stringent measures to help build traveler confidence; there’s every reason to believe we will be resilient once again.”  Check out our guide and find out when you can return to your favorite island (or try a new one) and swap those virtual happy hours for a rum punch by the water’s edge.   Puerto Rico  Ocean views at the San Juan Marriott Resort & Stellaris Casino in Puerto Rico. (Photo: Dan Ham, San Juan Marriott Resort & Stellaris Casino)  As part of its four-phased plan, the island opened for business on May 26 with face masks mandatory in public and enforced social distancing. According to the travel advisory issued by Discover Puerto Rico, the island’s destination marketing organization, new rules include screening on arrival at the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan where passengers might be asked to self-quarantine for 14 days, regardless of symptoms. A boatload of safety measures include restaurants operating with a maximum capacity of 25% and beaches open for surfing, jogging, swimming and kayaking (but no sunbathing). Golf courses are open with safety protocols in place. Many of the hotels are open as are malls and shops although trying on clothing is a no-no. Pool facilities are open at 25% capacity, within curfew hours, though spas and casinos remain closed. As a U.S. territory, no passports are needed for American citizens arriving from the U.S. mainland. For those who enjoy the path-less-taken, you’ll have to wait a little longer to visit the islands of Vieques and Culebra.   U.S. Virgin Islands  Magens Bay in St. Thomas is home to a large white sandy beach ideal for swimming and water sports. (Photo: U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Tourism)  With much anticipation, the U.S. Virgin Islands reopened to leisure travelers on June 1. Safety rules are in place for hotels, resorts, restaurants, bars, taxis, and a “No Mask, No Service,\" mandate is required by the government. Visitors to the trio of popular islands, St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John, are asked to travel with masks, sanitizers and wipes and will be screened upon arrival via thermal imaging.  Many of the hotels and resorts are open with the exception of Bolongo Bay Beach Resort in St. Thomas, reopening on July 1; Margaritaville Vacation Club by Wyndham – St. Thomas on July 2 and Ritz-Carlton, St. Thomas on July 15. What you’ll notice are no more mini-bars or buffets and six-foot-apart seating separations in restaurants. As a U.S. territory, no passports are needed for American citizens arriving from Puerto Rico or the U.S. mainland.   Saint Lucia  In Saint Lucia, Coconut Bay Beach is a 250-room all-inclusive for families. (Photo: Richard Hallman, Coconut Bay Beach Resort & Spa)  It’s all hands on deck for the June 4 reopening. Included in a laundry list of protocols, visitors are required to present certified proof of a negative COVID-19 test within 48 hours of boarding a flight, face masks must be worn upon arrival, and safety measures in taxis will separate drivers and passengers. Before resorts and hotels can open, they’ll need a COVID-19 certificate from the government that shows they've met more than a dozen criteria for sanitization.  Leading the pack with a July 1 reopening, Jade Mountain and sister resort Anse Chastanet have added enhanced hygiene measures, distanced seating in restaurants and touch-less interactions. Other hotels to open between July and October include Windjammer Landing, Coconut Bay Beach Resort, Ladera Resort, Sugar Beach, A Viceroy Resort and three Sandals Resorts.   Antigua  Sandals Grande Antigua is open on Dickenson Bay. (Photo: Sandals Resort)  Marking its tourism comeback on June 4, the island will reopen as the first of daily American Airlines flights from Miami touches down at the V.C. Bird International Airport. Safety and health protocols announced for arriving passengers include health declaration forms, screenings and thermal checks. They may also be asked to take a rapid antigen test at their hotel. Social-distancing rules must be adhered to in public areas, and face masks must be worn island-wide with the exception of at the beach. Many hotels are open now, including Sandals Grande Antigua; others will reopen later this month, during the summer and throughout the fall.   Jamaica  During a digital address to the nation, Prime Minister Andrew Holness announced ‘the borders will be open to international travelers on June 15. Health screenings will be conducted upon arrival, and face masks will be mandatory at the airport, in taxis and at the hotels and resorts. With stringent safety protocols in place, some hotels have announced reopening dates, including Sandals Resorts, Beaches Negril and Beaches Ocho Rios tentatively looking at a July reopening; Jamaica Inn in Ocho Rios at the end of June; Couples Negril, Couples Tower Isle, Couples Sans Souci and Couples Swept Away on July 1; Sunset at the Palms Resort in Negril on July 9; and Round Hill Hotel and Villas in Montego Bay on Sept. 1.   Aruba  Bucuti & Tara Beach Resort is an adults-only resort in Aruba. (Photo: Bucuti & Tara Beach Resort)  The Dutch island that sits below the hurricane belt is aiming to reopen sometime between June 15 and July 1. However, the government says this timeframe is tentative and may be subject change in order to “consider additional precautionary measures as needed.\" In order to reopen, hotels, taxis, restaurants, casinos, stores and tour operators must earn and display an Aruba Health & Happiness Code gold certification seal, a rigorous hygiene program put forward by the Aruba Tourism Authority and the Department of Public Health. At the airport, expect to find temperature checks, and at the hotels and resorts, you’ll find Plexiglas barriers, digital keys and contactless check-in. At the popular Arikok National Park, virtual guided tours will respect social distancing rules, and fATVsare banned. Voted the Best Caribbean Resort in the 2020 USA TODAY 10Best Readers' Choice Awards, Bucuti & Tara Beach Resort never closed – instead housing medical personnel and a KLM flight crew. The hotel is ready to welcome guests with contact-less check-in via a personal tablet and ionizer technology that removes bacteria in the air .   The Bahamas  In the Bahamas, Atlantis Paradise Island reopens on July 1. (Photo: Atlantis Paradise Island)  July 1 will mark the reopening of the borders to tourism under the guidelines of the “Tourism Readiness and Recovery Plan,” unveiled by the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism & Aviation. At the airports, temperatures will be checked, and travelers must wear face masks in “any situation where it is necessary to enforce physical distancing guidelines, while navigating security and customs screenings, and at baggage claim.”  Face masks will be required in taxis, and beach chairs must be arranged to allow six feet of physical distancing. “We must remember that we are living in a new normal, and a lot is going to change across the tourism sector, “said Joy Jibrilu, director general, Bahamas Ministry of Tourism & Aviation. Resorts on stream to open include Meliá Nassau Beach, Atlantis Paradise Island, Baha Mar, Sandals Royal Bahamian, Bay View Suites Paradise Island, Comfort Suites Paradise Island, Ocean Club, A Four Seasons Resort and Grand Isle Resort & Spa in Great Exuma.

From members of Congress to members of the media, political operatives to law professors, Barr is under intense scrutiny from the left for alleged \"misuse of the criminal justice system\" involving not only the Stone case, but the removal in January of U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu and accepting Ukraine-related information from Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.  He's also walking a fine line with the president himself, who pushed back against Barr's highly publicized comments Thursday that Trump had never asked him to intervene in a criminal case.  “This doesn’t mean that I do not have, as President, the legal right to do so, I do, but I have so far chosen not to!\" Trump tweeted Friday morning.  Barr will answer questions on all these issues in a March 31 appearance before the Democrat-controlled House Judiciary Committee.  BARR SAYS TRUMP TWEETS 'MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DO MY JOB' AMID ROGER STONE DRAMA  \"In your tenure as Attorney General, you have engaged in a pattern of conduct in legal matters relating to the President that raises significant questions for this Committee,\" wrote House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., in a letter confirming that Barr would testify, which he signed along with some of his fellow committee members. \"In the past week alone, you have taken steps that raise grave questions about your leadership of the Department on Justice.\"  Earlier this week, four Department of Justice prosecutors resigned to their posts after top DOJ officials stepped in to soften their 7- to 9-year recommended sentence of Stone following a tweet by Trump about the case. Democrats called the move \"without precedent\" and sharpened their already simmering criticisms of Barr.  Stone was convicted of witness tampering, among other charges.  DOJ PROSECUTORS RESIGN AFTER TOP BRASS REVERSES COURSE ON ROGER STONE SENTENCING  Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Barr “ought to be ashamed and embarrassed and resign as a result of this action directly interfering in the independent prosecution of Roger Stone.” He also said the controversy was yet another example of “political interference by the president to alter the independent decisions of the Department of Justice.”  Nadler didn’t answer a question on whether Barr should resign, but said: “I think the behavior is extremely egregious.”  Barr, on ABC News Thursday, pushed back on Trump's tweet while also defending his handling of the Stone case.  \"I'm gonna do what I think is right,\" he said, \"and you know, I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me.\"  White House officials told Fox News that they knew Barr was doing the ABC interview but that they did not know what the AG would say.  Democrats, largely, didn't buy Barr's explanation.  \"What Bill Barr REALLY means is that Trump’s tweets saying the quiet part out loud are making it harder for him to do the crimes and cover-up,\" Jon Cooper, chairman of the anti-Trump organization Democratic Coalition, tweeted.  DEMOCRAT WON'T RULE OUT NEW TRUMP IMPEACHMENT OVER ROGER STONE CASE  This followed Democrats' condemnation of Barr's willingness to accept Ukraine-related information from Giuliani, prompting Nadler to wonder whether Barr is \"in league with Mr. Giuliani and his associates.\" Barr has been a lightning rod for most of his time as the top law enforcement officer in the United States, including for his handling of the former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russia's interference in the 2016 election and his decision not to charge Trump with obstruction of justice based on the report.  \"This situation has all the indicia of improper political interference in a criminal prosecution,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a letter to DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz on the Stone sentencing. \"I therefore request that you immediately investigate this matter to determine how and why the Stone sentencing recommendations were countermanded, which Justice Department officials made this decision, and which White House officials were involved.\"  Some on the left have even called for Barr's impeachment, including MSNBC legal analyst Glenn Kirschner, who tweeted before the Stone developments last week that Barr has lied \"to Congress, he lied about the Mueller report, he refuses to investigate obvious crimes by the administration, he is conflicted out of many matters but refuses to recuse.\"  Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., told CNN Wednesday that he wouldn't rule out launching a new impeachment inquiry into Trump himself over the drama around Stone and Barr.  \"You know, we’re not going to take our options off the table,\" he said. \"We want to work with him on prescription drugs, background checks, and infrastructure, but we’re not going to let him just torch this democracy because he thinks that he’s been let off once and we’re not going to do something about it.\"  Others to mention impeachment include Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., liberal Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe and self-labeled conservative Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin. House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., condemned Barr on Thursday and called for an investigation but did not outright call for impeachment. Sen. Cory Booker joined calls for an investigation.  \"Justice in America should not depend on your wealth and connections,\" Booker said in a tweet. \"I agree with [Schumer] — DOJ OIG should open an investigation into improper political interference in the Stone case.\"  At the same time, Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Chris Coons, D-Del., and Booker, among others, hit Barr in a joint statement on \"the politicization and maladministration of American immigration courts under President Donald Trump.\" The statement announced a letter they sent to Barr asking for documents on the matter.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Republicans, meanwhile, have largely stuck by Barr. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., released a statement backing the AG on Thursday.  \"President Trump, in selecting Bill Barr to be Attorney General, has done a great service to the people serving in the Department of Justice and our nation as a whole,\" Graham said. \"He is the right man at the right time to reform the Department and stand up for the Rule of Law. Attorney General Barr has my complete confidence.\"  Fox News' Mark Meredith, Brooke Singman, Marisa Schultz and Gregg Re contributed to this report.

Dubbed by some as a symbol of Britain's independence from the European Union, where members have burgundy coloured passports, the new passports, based on the country's traditional pre-EU passports, have started arriving through people's letterboxes.  But while the change has been celebrated by politicians such as Home Secretary Priti Patel, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, not everyone is happy.  And the main cause for concern is the argument over the passport's colour.  The change to a blue passport has been celebrated by politicians such as Home Secretary Priti Patel (pictured), Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage  One Twitter user said: 'New passport arrived this morning, had almost completely forgotten about the completely pointless change in colour.  'By the way, it is definitely black and not even remotely blue.'  Twitter user Andrew Wilson said: 'Did I miss a meeting? I thought Brexit was all so we could get a blue passport and this pops through the post. Black.'  Another, Andrshley Gorman added: 'And to top off the misery, the passport is black (not even blue?!), really poor quality, flimsy and third, and the edges are peeling.'  Others meanwhile say the new passport is the same colour as the old passport - but claimed that was in fact black as well.  One said: 'It was always back. Look. My passport from 1989. Black.'  Another said: 'The old passport was never blue. I used to have one. Dark navy/black, bigger and 'hardback'.  'The people complaining about wanting a blue passport back missed one vital element, we never had a blue passport in the first place. A totally fabricated outrage.'  Meanwhile, another joked: 'That old British passport is either black or very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very dark blue.'  Others though have claimed the old passport is in fact blue, with one person picturing it up against a black background.  He said: 'Here, against a black background, is a blue passport. Final means final.'  The two passports, the new British passport (left) and the old British passport (right) look almost identical in colour - but are they blue or black?  ‹ Slide me › This picture released by the Home Office appears to show the newer passport as being lighter in colour than the old British passport  The Home Office has in the past described the change of documents as a return to the country's 'iconic blue passports'.  But they have refused to specify exactly which shade of colour they have used.  Experts meanwhile have weighted into the debate.  Stephen Westland, professor of colour science and technology at the University of Leeds, previously told the BBC: 'I'd say it's black, if most people looked at this, they'd say it's black.'  Craig Burston, senior lecturer in graphic design at the London College of Communication added: 'It must be the most apologetic shade of blue they could find'.  Blue passports were first introduced in Britain in 1921.  But they were phased out after 1988 when members of the then European Economic Community agreed to harmonise designs to a burgundy colour.  The Home Office has in the past described the change of documents as a return to the country's 'iconic blue passports'. Picutred: Boris Johnson with one of the new blue British passports  The government announced the introduction of the new navy blue passports in 2017, a year after Britain voted to leave the EU.  A return to dark blue was announced by then Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis, who said people wanted to 'see that things are different' following the vote to leave the EU.  Blue passports were first introduced in Britain in 1921. But they were phased out after 1988 when members of the then European Economic Community agreed to harmonise designs to a burgundy colour  Brexiteers championed Mr Lewis's decision to reintroduce blue passports - and they became a symbol of the Leave campaign.  The travel documents were lauded by members of the European Research Group, including Leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg.  In February, the Home Office announced the 'iconic' colour would return for the first time in almost 30 years from March.  But those who have applied for passports in recent months may still have received a burgundy passport, as they finish the remaining stock.  However, there was previously outrage after it emerged the contract for British travel documents after Brexit had been given to a Franco-Dutch firm called Gemalto.  The decision meant Gateshead-based firm De La Rue, who did it before, lost out on the contract and 170 jobs were lost.  Britons who receive burgundy passport now, but want a blue one, could be stuck with theirs until 2030, as they last for 10 years.

Results from a Teaching, Research, & International Policy (TRIP) survey of 708 international relations scholars at US universities found that international relations scholars are far more likely to support Biden than Trump for president and overwhelmingly agree that Biden will be better able to achieve his foreign policy agenda.  Experts who identify themselves as Republicans and Independents are far more skeptical of Trump's approach to foreign policy than are their co-partisans in the US population at large, the survey found.  Respondents to the survey overwhelmingly said that foreign governments will be more willing to cooperate with the United States if Biden (92 per cent) wins the election than if Trump (2 per cent) wins.  By a significant margin, 95 per cent of the experts agreed that Biden will be a more effective foreign policy president than Trump (5 percent).  Further, if the election were held today, more than 94 per cent of IR faculty who are eligible to vote would cast a vote for Biden, and 5 per cent would vote for Trump, the survey found.  Despite concerns about foreign election interference, most scholars are confident that Russia, Iran, and China will not significantly impact the outcome of the election.  They do believe, however, that foreign efforts to interfere will undermine American citizens' confidence in election results, the survey said, adding that the experts see Russia as the most pernicious of the three states when it comes to election meddling, even though they see the rise of Chinese power and influence as a greater long-term threat to the United States than the rise of Russian power and influence.  The experts also believe that Trump and Biden's foreign policies would differ most markedly in the areas of climate change, engagement with multilateral organisations, and global public health.  The scholars surveyed see the most similarities between the two candidates' policies on exchange rate policy, counterterrorism, and the use of military force abroad.  The survey found that 88.5 per cent of scholars believe climate change is a major global threat, followed by the spread of infectious diseases, with 76 per cent agreeing that it is a major threat to society.  Over 70 per cent of international relation scholars believe that former President Barack Obama outperformed Trump in foreign policy areas.  Teaching, Research, and International Policy (TRIP) Project Snap Polls survey all faculty members employed at a US university in a political science department or policy school who teach or conduct research on issues that cross international borders.  Michael J. Tierney, Hylton Professor of Government at William & Mary said relations with China, cybersecurity, and global public health provide dim rays of hope for bipartisanship, whereas issues like climate change are likely to remain quite partisan.  He added that while the experts expect big differences between the two candidates when it comes to policy on climate change, immigration, and collaboration within multilateral organisations, they see less of a difference when it comes to use of military force abroad and counter-terrorism policy.

Online firms such as Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb have expanded consumer options in ways few imagined before the rise of the internet. In this respect, the digital age has strengthened the power of exit beyond what Albert Hirschman might have expected when Exit, Voice, and Loyalty was first published fifty years ago.  But appreciation for the benefits of digital exit should not be allowed to obscure the importance of exit rights in physical space, which is where all of us still live. No technological innovation provides an adequate substitute for the power to \"vote with your feet\" by choosing where to live and work. That is particularly true for the world's poorest and most disadvantaged people, many of whom are trapped under the rule of oppressive and corrupt regimes. While digital exit rights have improved in recent years, foot voting options have all too often been diminished….  For the vast majority of people, where you are allowed to live still determines how much freedom you have, whether you are subject to a variety of forms of oppression, and what employment and educational opportunities are open to you….  Despite his reservations about some aspects of exit rights, Hirschman pointed out that \"[t]he United States owes its very existence and growth to millions of decisions favoring exit over voice\" (106)…. Today, unfortunately, this heritage has been compromised by the most severe immigration restrictions in American history—adopted on the pretext of combating the coronavirus pandemic, by an administration that in fact seeks to extend them indefinitely. It is also endangered by restrictive zoning and other barriers to internal mobility. If not reversed, these trends will also endanger the innovation lauded by Thierer, since both international and internal migrants are major contributors to technological and commercial innovation.  As we cope with the coronavirus crisis and associated economic damage, America needs innovation and growth as much as ever. And millions of people around the world desperately need greater freedom and opportunity. We can achieve both by empowering more people to use exit rights to vote with their feet.

The 2 p.m. ceremony on Saturday will take place in a virtual Minecraft version of the Cal campus and feature keynote speeches from Cal’s chancellor, CEOs from tech companies Razer and Twitch, as well as graduating seniors.  “It should be a pretty unique experience for everyone,” said Bjorn Lustic, a former Cal student who launched the effort. “This has never been done before.”  The project began when Lustic decided to create a virtual version of Cal’s Memorial Stadium where a graduation ceremony could take place in Minecraft, an online game that allows participants to design a world out of blocks — sort of like virtual Legos. Soon others began to expand on Lustic’s idea and a detailed version of Cal’s entire campus in which players can walk around, began to bloom. They named their version of the campus “Blockeley.”  Lustic’s idea of holding a virtual graduation ceremony in the game got a giant boost when Cal Berkeley’s administration came onboard, lending an aspect of credibility along with helping to spread word about the event.  “It just went from having five friends to 4,000 people,” Lustic said.   Blockeley team  Lustic said the event now has a production company involved in the planning — as well as companies like Razer and Twitch which will stream the graduation speeches in sync with the events occurring in the Minecraft world.  “Once we’re done with the speeches,” Lustic said, “we made it so you can throw up a cap and gown so you kind of get that graduation feeling of celebrating.”  Graduating senior Nick Pickett recalled the day the campus closed in March because of the pandemic, forcing he and others students to making hasty departures from campus.  “It was a lot of scrambling and panicking and just not fun,” Pickett said. “I didn’t get to say goodbye to a lot of people.”  Pickett was disappointed when the school cancelled graduation ceremonies, but immediately got involved helping to design Blockeley. He’s now serving as the director for Saturday’s graduation ceremony which he will also take part in.  “It’s not the real thing,” Pickett said, “but it’s something so unique in of itself, that we’re kind of all just loving the opportunity.”  Pickett said he was reviewing some of the advance versions of speeches to be delivered on Saturday, when he noticed many touched upon a common theme.  “A lot of them start along the lines of ‘I don’t remember my graduation speaker,’” Pickett said. “I’m sure going to remember this.”  The graduation ceremony will be followed by a 4 p.m. virtual music festival, with as many as 90 performers taking part over several days. Lustic said the idea was to replace what was lost with something so unique it would make-up for the pomp and circumstance many departing seniors will miss out on.  “I think it’s a nice gesture for us to kind of give them the opportunity to come and get some closure from the university,” Lustic said.
