{"data": [{"text": " Reddit Email 7K Shares  Understanding Trump’s game plan in Portland could be the key to preventing a coup in November. Defeating Trump’s “law and order” strategy will mean creating a plan to win based on our strengths and his weaknesses.   George Lakey | –  (Waging Nonviolence ) – While outrage was still growing in Oregon over federal agents’ intervention in Portland, President Trump on July 20 named Chicago, New York, Detroit, Baltimore and Oakland, California as possible next targets. Since then Albuquerque was added to the list.  Although the agents’ mission was supposedly to protect federal buildings, they were ranging around the city, dressed in camouflage outfits in unmarked vans, joining police in responding to demonstrators. The New York Times reported them seizing people and locking them into a van with no explanation and wearing no insignia.  The feds began to arrive June 27 and have ramped up in numbers since. The Washington Post reported that a curious 53-year-old Navy vet, Christopher David, approached a demonstration where he saw agents acting aggressively. He asked the officers to remember their oaths to protect the Constitution. They attacked him and broke his hand.  Agents were assembled from Customs and Border Protection, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. According to The New York Times, “The tactical agents deployed by Homeland Security include officials from a group known as BORTAC, the Border Patrol’s equivalent of a SWAT team — a highly trained group that normally is tasked with investigating drug smuggling organizations, as opposed to protesters in cities.”  Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler called it “an attack on our democracy.” That was before he was tear-gassed on the street in a demonstration. Oregon Attorney Gen. Ellen Rosenblum filed a lawsuit, seeking a restraining order.  Gov. Kate Brown, who called Trump’s intervention “a blatant abuse of power,” said that the protests were starting to ease before federal officers arrived. What might have prompted Trump to act? Why Portland? How might this choice be strategic for Trump, both to bolster his chance to win the election — and perhaps to remain in office even if he doesn’t win? And what can activists do about it?  Trump’s “law and order” strategy really can help him win  Trump’s earlier hopes to win based on a strong economy and conquest of the coronavirus have faded. He needs another emotional issue that responds to people’s need for security: public order. The narrative couldn’t be clearer. In new advertising and tweets Trump has argued that Biden “is a harbinger of chaos and destruction.” During a two-week period in July the Trump campaign spent nearly $14 million to air a television spot suggesting that police departments won’t respond to 911 calls if Biden is elected.  Trump’s team figures that a percentage of voters who might otherwise be ambivalent about him can be tipped toward supporting him by appealing to their anxiety. In the 1960s, when the nonviolent civil rights movement moved national public opinion sufficiently to pass two landmark U.S. civil rights acts, I watched a series of riots in Philadelphia and elsewhere, from 1965-66, break the movement’s momentum.  To measure the impact of riots carefully scholars have examined other examples. Princeton political scientist Omar Wasow studied the April 1968 riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. I was one of the many outraged in the streets — although, our Philadelphia Black-led mass protest was nonviolent.  Wasow found that the violent protests measurably helped Republican Richard Nixon become President in 1968. (His study kicked off a recent dialogue, including Nathan J. Robinson’s critique in Current Affairs. However, Robinson admits he doesn’t challenge the fact that right-winger Nixon did benefit from the riot.)  Another Princeton researcher, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, investigated the outcome of the 1992 Los Angeles rebellion — also sparked by a just cause — and found it resulted in the Democrats moving to a “law and order” posture, mass incarceration and increased poverty.  Clearly, the Trump team’s strategic calculation on voter behavior is a reasonable one. But why target Oregon for this intervention?  Portland is known nationally for having some activists who try to defend themselves against police violence in a violent way. By sending in federal agents who will escalate violent tactics, there seemed a good chance of getting video footage for Trump’s election campaign, proclaiming him as “the law and order candidate.” With luck they would get vivid pictures at the site of federal buildings that give the feds their protective justification for being there.  A long-time white anti-racist activist and conflict studies professor at Portland State University, Tom Hastings, told me another reason why Portland is an obvious choice for Trump’s team: Oregon’s electoral votes were already certain to go to Biden. It doesn’t matter for November’s election that Oregon’s major elected officials are protesting the federal intervention. Hastings also pointed out that the cities on Trump’s list for more interventions have Democratic mayors.  Will activists play Trump’s game?  One key to a winning strategy is to figure out what the opponent’s strategy is and refuse to be manipulated — in Portland and in the other cities on Trump’s target list.  Federal intervention in Portland has turned the previous hundreds of late-night protesters into thousands. Nonviolent tactics include dancing, a “Wall of Moms,” and orange-clad dads with leaf-blowers, who blow away tear gas.  Other activists have escalated violent tactics in response to the escalation by the feds. According to The New York Times, some of the protesters used lasers while federal officers fired projectiles into the crowd. Court papers claim that a Molotov cocktail was thrown and one protester was charged with hitting an officer with a hammer, while the Times reported multiple efforts by some protesters to set alight the wood on the façade of the federal courthouse. The fire attempt of course reinforces Trump’s dubious claim that the feds need to be there to protect federal property.  Activists everywhere can learn from the major shift in tactics made this year by looking at the national response to the May 25 police killing in Minneapolis of George Floyd. Our spontaneous reactions expressed grief and anger in multiple ways.  The mass media (as usual) gave most headlines to the rioting. That meant, as historical research has shown, the impact of the movement could have set back the struggle for racial justice. However, from the start, the vast majority of people were protesting nonviolently. The more fact-based mass media caught up with that quickly. The rioting quickly ebbed, and the image of the movement shifted to one that fairly consistent uses nonviolent action.  When police in some locations continued to act out violently against the peaceable demonstrators, they only proved the point demonstrators were making. Their brutality displayed on nightly TV boomeranged against them, and more people joined the protests.  Almost all activists found far more effective ways to escalate than using fire and projectiles: They escalated the contrast between their behavior and that of the police.  By channeling rage and grief into nonviolent tactics, the Black Lives Matter surge sustained itself, grew exponentially, introduced new people to the streets and a national conversation about racial injustice. It continues to chalk up a series of limited victories. Bigger victories await even more focused nonviolent campaigning.  Any effective strategizing — Trump’s or ours — includes a back-up plan, and my guess is that the Trump team has one. If Portland activists refuse to play into Trump’s hand by adopting a nonviolent discipline, Trump has a list of other places to try. Trump can hope that in Chicago or Oakland activists might not see how much he wants them to fall for his ploy.  A more sinister goal Trump may have in mind  When announcing to the media his list of targeted cities, Trump revealed how important this narrative is to him. His next statement was that if Joe Biden is elected, “the whole country would go to hell. And we’re not going to let it go to hell.”  Although Trump would undoubtedly claim voting fraud because of mailed-in ballots, the emotionally more impactful narrative would be “hell” in the form of violent chaos in the streets happening in real time following the vote. He has plenty of armed Trump loyalists ready to do their part. While the courts wrangle about voting fraud, the chaos can serve as Trump’s immediate rationale for staying in the White House in January.  The “violent chaos” narrative is Trump’s growing emphasis, and I think it’s linked to his hope that police will give a break to Trump-followers in the streets. On July 19 on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace, Trump said again that he would not agree ahead of time to obey the results of the election. But then he added, “Biden wants to defund the police.” As I mentioned, his campaign is already investing millions in TV ads attacking Biden’s capacity to support the public’s basic need for safety and security.  Even a man as reckless as Trump likely knows that initiating a Constitutional crisis is an unusually chancy operation. He needs preparation even to have a chance of success. By “success” I mean at least making a deal in which he and his family would avoid the parade of lawsuits that await him when he is no longer in office.  I see him and his team taking a number of steps to prepare. Right now in Portland he’s trying out the narrative that justifies a refusal to exit.   Embed from Getty Images  Chaos is good for him. For years he’s been preparing his base to produce an armed force of “irregulars” that can generate chaos. Armed men are showing up in places of political tension and conspicuously being allowed to remain there by local police. Examples include April 30 in Lansing, Michigan, June 2 in Philadelphia and July 20 at the Utah State Capitol.  Trump also needs the legitimacy of a governmental force at his command. On his home ground in Washington, D.C. he experimented with soldiers in combat gear and military helicoptors attacking peaceful demonstrators to clear the way for a photo-op.  That test didn’t work out well. The demonstrators didn’t turn to violence to give him justification, so the media revealed a military behaving disgracefully. Trump received enormous push-back from military leaders. They clearly vetoed further use of the their forces for his own political purposes.  Still wanting the availability of loyal government guns, in Portland he’s testing civilian federal armed agencies that represent governmental legitimacy. Chad Wolf, the acting head of Homeland Security underlined his loyalty when he visited Portland on July 16. How that works out is yet to be seen.  Since Trump does believe in the art of the deal, if a take-over doesn’t work he needs also political enablers with some credibility who will step in to arrange a compromise that protects Trump and his family when they leave. He’s in good shape there. Republican leaders have plenty of practice enabling Trump’s corruption and presumably will be available for this service in the midst of a crisis that’s not turning his way.  What strategy can defend against a coup?  Jo Ann Hardesty is a long-time activist and Black community leader in Portland who became a city commissioner last year. In the midst of this crisis she voiced the most important strategic insight that activists need, although not an easy one to grasp.  On July 20, she called a mass protest outside the county Justice Center downtown, saying the city would “not allow armed military forces to attack our people.”  At the rally she gave us the key: “Today we show the country and the world that the city of Portland, even as much as we fight among ourselves, will come together to stand up for our Constitutional rights.”  The key is unity — a challenging concept in a polarized time, especially for those of us who think of ourselves as social change activists.  A successful direct action campaign for change, after all, doesn’t start out assuming unity with our point of view. Change activists generally start out as a minority voice, often a tiny minority, like the first women who asserted the right to vote or the first LGBT people demanding freedom to be who we are.  Our initial minority typically finds allies, persuades more doubters, and reaches the point of launching direct action, becoming what Bayard Rustin called “angelic troublemakers” who dramatize our point of view. Then, when we grow and achieve critical mass, we polarize the issue in such a way that the center of gravity comes down on our side — leading us to victory.  In Hardesty’s words, change activists in Portland (and everywhere) assume we’ll “fight among ourselves” hoping our point of view will someday win out. However, she calls us to learn to do more than only one thing. She wants us to be able at one moment to fight for change and at another moment to be able to fight for defense, to protect something worth defending.  She believes that the city of Portland, for all its problems, is worth defending against Trump’s attack. You likely agree that your city, or state or country, is worth defending against a would-be dictator.  But here’s the challenge to us: Strategizing for defense is different from strategizing for change.  When we’re on defense, we not only minimize actions that polarize, as Hardesty says, but we also design actions that play more to the center. The “center” is the people in your system (be it your community or nation) who are not committed strongly one way or the other.  The leaders in a stable system pay a lot of attention to the people in center and also, as leaders, they see themselves as balancers who need to hold things together in whatever system they’re leading. (The military leadership in the United States is an example of this.) They usually think “leadership” means at least some care for the system’s cohesion, integrity and security.  What this means for activists gets clearer in a story about a puzzle I watched environmental organizers solve.  Finding the difference between offense and defense  When I was consulting with the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League, I saw their local organizers make sense of a confusing and surprising phenomenon. Their issue was commercial waste companies trying to dump toxic waste in local communities.  The organizers had been schooled in social change projects and were therefore accustomed to entering a community, finding some sympathetic people more on the periphery of the community (perhaps a Black minister, a white union member, a Jewish teacher, a Unitarian librarian) who agreed that toxics shouldn’t be dumped there. By supporting the activism of these initial contacts and using house meetings to follow their links in toward the power center of the community, the organizers expected at last to rouse the leaders of the community to join in defense against the waste haulers.  To their surprise, the organizers discovered that the leaders of the community frequently “jumped the gun,” adopting the defense against toxics as their own issue and even taking leadership in organizing sit-downs in front of the trucks.  By comparing experiences, the organizers realized that community leaders believed they needed to be seen as defending their system against violations of its integrity and security.  On a national level, this is why Republican leaders are so uneasy about Trump’s relationship with Putin and his denial of Russian electoral attacks. Their conflict is between their loyalty to Trump and their own responsibility to defend the system’s integrity against attack from outside. That responsibility goes with being part of the system’s center.  When Jo Ann Hardesty spoke at the rally, she was coaching activists to see the difference between offense and defense. She said, “This is not about ‘Fuck the police.’ This is not about who did what, when. As you know, Portlanders will continue to fight once we get rid of these federal occupying forces. But when Portland is under attack, whether you’re Black or white, whether you’re right or left, Portlanders come together.”  Defeating an attempted coup – nonviolently  When Germans overthrew would-be dictator Wolfgang Kapp in 1920, they used a defensive strategy. It wasn’t easy. World War I left Germany intensely polarized, much more than the United States is now. The right wing saw an opportunity to try a coup d’etat, backed by some of the armed forces.  Germany’s center read the attempt as an attack on the integrity and security of the system, and responded to the left when it called for a general strike. Along with ordinary people staying home, governmental civil servants failed to show up for work.  Kapp found empty offices, with no one to type out a manifesto saying he was the new ruler of Germany. He needed to bring his daughter to the capitol the next day to do the typing!  Even an economically battered, partly destroyed, and politically divided Germany found so many leaders and ordinary people linked to that sense of integrity and security of the whole system that within a week the coup was defeated by nonviolent defense.

As Bill McKibben is fond of saying, “Stop being an individual.” Recruit your activist group. Talk with others about our possible need to use Jo Ann Hardesty’s call for an “all-in” shift from change to defense.  On Zoom calls discuss with others cases of community and national defense, hundreds of which are available on the Global Nonviolent Action Database.  As you read cases, note what the strengths were that winning activists used, and ask what you and your comrades’ strengths are. If you’ve done only change activism up until now, build your flexibility so you can start or join defense actions as well. With people in the center in mind, think “unity” rather than “further polarization.”  Don’t under-rate our opponent. Just because it’s easy to deride Trump’s limited information about things we think are important, like the virus, is no reason to under-estimate how wily he is, how he “reads” his opponents and goes after their (and our) weak points.  One of our weak points is that many of us would rather moralize than strategize. Trump enjoys being outrageous so he can watch us react — and then waste our time moralizing.  If you’re out late at night and and get attacked on the street, it’s a waste of time and brain-space to analyze the ethics of the attacker. Similarly, we’ll do better in an attempted coup if we give up moralizing and identify our strengths, Trump’s weaknesses and create a strategy to win.  Acknowledge your fears, to yourself and friends. If in contemporary America you have no fear, you simply don’t understand what’s up. I find my teeth chattering more often these days, which is a way of acknowledging and letting go of my fear.  Build on the strengths of previous movements that found ways to handle threats and attacks.  One way to practice your strategy chops is to keep looking at tactical possibilities for nonviolent noncooperation. This formula might help you:  Ask: “What do they want me to do?” Then don’t do it.  Ask: What don’t they want me to do?” Then consider it.  The United States is a polarized country. The path of least resistance is for each pole to become obsessed by the other: The right wing wastes time learning about and despising us, and vice versa. That’s the trap.  The way out is to pay attention to the center, which especially in defense scenarios, is the prize. Learn about centrists, make friends with them, discuss your points of agreement and disagreement. Your growth as an activist is guaranteed.  Our own fear may urge us to “look good” to our comrades, perhaps by doubling down on whatever campaign we’re now involved with. Our campaigns (for racial justice, immigrant justice, stopping a pipeline, etc.) are in one sense addressing sub-systems. That’s good, because in ordinary times the sub-system offers concrete gains when we win.  However, if my analysis is correct, in this situation what’s in play is the national system as a whole, which will make it more critical for a moment — and also will make the center available in a new way.  Remind your friends that because the center is easily alarmed by disorder and especially violence, its willingness to defend the whole depends partly on the degree to which it sees “our side” as nonviolent and “the threat” as violent. Because the overwhelming majority of Portlanders have been demonstrating for Black Lives Matter in nonviolent ways, elected officials are mobilizing against Trump’s intervention. If the majority had been violent, Trump’s intervention would be welcomed by the center.  Reduced to bare bones, our three-point plan in this political moment may be: stand with the community as a whole, communicate the power of strategic nonviolent action, and then — as Hardesty reminds us — as soon as Trump is really out, we can return to our disagreements and our struggle for revolutionary change!

Nearby were the last of his belongings: a tube of toothpaste, a few foam cups, and a sheet of paper explaining how he could request his release from immigration detention. He had already been denied three times.  The Cuban man had been placed in solitary six days earlier because he told his jailers he would refuse all meals to protest his detention. The jailers put him there even after medical staff had referred him for mental health treatment three times and documented an intestinal disorder that caused him excruciating pain.  And for at least an hour before he was found to have hanged himself, no one had opened the door to check whether he was alive.  His death might have been prevented. An Associated Press investigation into Hernandez's death last October found neglect and apparent violations of government policies by jailers under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, at a time when detention of migrants has reached record levels and new questions have arisen about the U.S. government's treatment of people seeking refuge.  ICE requires migrants detained in solitary confinement to be visually observed every 30 minutes. Surveillance video shows a jail guard walking past Hernandez's cell twice in the hour before he was found, writing in a binder stored on the wall next to his cell door. She doesn't lift the flap over the cell door window or try to look inside. The last person to look in the window was an unidentified jail employee, 40 minutes before Hernandez was found.  A person who works at the jail and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity says the jail later discovered Hernandez couldn't be seen from the window.  'I think they let him die,' said Yarelis Gutierrez Barrios, his partner.  Hernandez spent most of his 43 years rebelling against Cuba's Communist government and spent years traveling South and Central America with Gutierrez before arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in May 2019.  After presenting himself legally at a border bridge in El Paso, Hernandez was taken into custody and eventually transferred to the Richwood Correctional Center in Monroe, Louisiana.  Looking to fill prisons emptied by criminal justice reform, rural Louisiana communities filled jail beds with asylum seekers and other migrants. At one point last year, Louisiana had about 8,000 migrants in detention, second only to Texas and up from about 2,000 migrants at the end of the Obama administration.  Louisiana also has become notorious for the broad denial of parole to migrants, particularly large populations of Cubans, Venezuelans, and people from South Asia. A federal judge in September ruled that ICE's New Orleans field office was violating the agency's own guidelines by failing to give each migrant a case-by-case determination of whether they could be released.  Hernandez had irritable bowel syndrome. People who knew him remember seeing him in constant pain. The syndrome also has been associated with anxiety and depression.  He was placed in solitary confinement for threatening a hunger strike after being denied parole and told by a judge that he would have to wait months longer to press his asylum case.  The interior of the cell where Hernandez was held when he died did not have video surveillance, according to the Ouachita Parish Sheriff's Office, the local law enforcement agency called to investigate soon after he was found dead.  But the sheriff's office obtained video from the hallway outside his cell that captures the last hour before his body was found. This is what it shows:  --1:19 p.m.: A guard walks up to Hernandez's door. She takes a binder from the wall next to the door, writes in it, then puts the binder back on the wall. She never looks into the window of Hernandez's cell door.  --1:26: A man in street clothes walking by the cell stops to open the flap over the cell door window and looks inside. The sheriff's office says the man was a jail employee but doesn't have his name in its records.  --1:54: The female guard comes back. Again, she takes the binder, writes in it, and puts the binder back without looking into the cell.  --2:04: Three staff members and what appears to be a jail trusty walk past the cell, filling most of the hallway. Going around the small crowd, a jail captain walks closer to the wall and comes next to Hernandez's cell door. The captain, identified by the sheriff's office as Gerald Hardwell, later told investigators he had noticed a 'strong odor' emanating from the cell.  He had discovered that Hernandez hanged himself with a bed sheet tied to the post of his bunk bed.  Photos taken of his body show that Hernandez may have been dead for several hours before he was found, based on how the blood had pooled in his hands, according to an analysis done at AP's request by Dr. Nizam Peerwani, the medical examiner for Fort Worth, Texas, and a forensic expert with the advocacy group Physicians for Human Rights.  ICE declined to answer most questions for this story. Spokesman Bryan Cox said ICE 'holds its personnel, including contractors, to the highest standards of professional and ethical behavior.'  Scott Sutterfield, a development executive for LaSalle Corrections, the prison company that runs Richwood, declined to answer any questions 'due to pending litigation.' 'I can say that LaSalle Corrections is firmly committed to the health and welfare of all those in our custody,' Sutterfield said.  Aside from Yarelis Gutierrez, Hernandez left behind two daughters and a son, as well as his mother and father.  When he left home for the last time, his family knew he hoped to get to America with the intention of making money to support them. Now, they have many questions about his death: How someone so strong in his convictions could have taken his own life? What happened to him in the jail, and why?  'He had struggled to get to this country, because he loved this country, he loved it with all his life,' Gutierrez said. 'He gave his life for this country.'

In a New York Times op-ed Monday, Dr. Gabriel Leung wrote that he was meeting with the World Health Organization (WHO) to discuss the spread of the virus, which experts have officially called CoViD-19.  \"We need to get a clear view of the contagion and plug the holes in our understanding of the disease to inform public health decisions that affect hundreds of millions of lives,\" wrote Leung. \"Science has a critical role to play in restoring calm.\"  \"If there is anything the coronavirus reminds us, it's that a global threat anywhere is a global threat everywhere.\"  —Liz Schrayer, U.S. Global Leadership Coalition  The respiratory disease has so far infected more than 40,000 people in total, with only about 400 cases in countries outside China. Two people have died of the disease in countries other than China, in the Philippines and Hong Kong. By Monday, more than 1,000 people in China had died of the disease. At least 12 people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, according to the CDC.  Leung told The Guardian Tuesday that WHO must take stock of the emergency measures that China has taken in recent weeks since the virus originated in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, and determine whether they are working.  Late last month, Chinese officials ordered a lockdown of Wuhan which then was expanded to all of Hubei province, barricading 50 million people in the province's borders. Health officials have been going from house to house in Wuhan, taking residents' temperatures, rounding up those who show signs of the coronavirus, and quarantining the sick in makeshift hospitals that have been constructed in stadiums and exhibition centers.  \"Let's assume that they have worked. But how long can you close schools for? How long can you lock down an entire city for? How long can you keep people away from shopping malls? And if you remove those [restrictions], then is it all going to come right back and rage again? So those are very real questions,\" Leung told the outlet.  The global health community may have \"another unpalatable truth to face\" if the lockdown has not worked, reported Sarah Boseley in The Guardian: \"that the coronavirus might not be possible to contain.\"  \"Then the world will have to switch tracks: instead of trying to contain the virus, it will have to work to mitigate its effects,\" Boseley wrote.  The current rate of infection outside China could be the \"tip of the iceberg,\" Leung told The Guardian.  The rate of transmission of the virus is 60 to 80%, with infected patients spreading the disease to more than two people. Health experts are still trying to determine if the virus is spread through airborne particles or through coughing.  WHO is emphasizing in its guidance that the risk of contracting coronavirus is very low for people outside China, with the seasonal flu posing a greater threat. According to the New York Times, the rate of new infections in China outside Hubei province has declined as of Tuesday.  In the U.S., Democratic lawmakers slammed the Trump administration Monday after it announced it would slash funding to global health programs by 34%.

Opponents submitted nearly 80,000 public comments before Wednesday's deadline, with about 20,000 in the final hours. The Trump administration must address each concern in the final rules, setting itself up for legal challenges if it rushes or is careless.  'This is kind of standard administrative law trench warfare,' said Jonathan Adler, a professor at Case Western University School of Law. 'It has been the case for some time that opponents of an agency action initially seek to flood the zone with comments and procedural objections as a way of slowing things down and cause a mistake, try to cause an unforced error.'  The proposal directs immigration judges to be more selective about granting asylum claims and allows them to deny some without a court hearing.

Trump has already remade much of the system for seeking humanitarian protection in the U.S., claiming it's rife with abuse and overwhelmed with undeserving claims. But courts recently knocked down some of his efforts on procedural grounds, including his bid to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals that shields about 700,000 young people from deportation.  Groups taking aim at the newest proposal focusing on immigration courts urged supporters to issue comments. HIAS, a group that assists refugees, hosted a briefing for 370 people two weeks ago.  Nearly 10,000 people used a 'click to comment' feature on Catholic Legal Immigration Network Inc.'s website, which included a template and advice on writing effectively, said Jill Marie Bussey, director of advocacy.  'These regulations would plunge the United States into moral darkness,' the group said in its own 101-page letter.  Under the administration's proposal, immigration judges, who work for the U.S. Justice Department, could reject 'legally deficient' asylum claims without a court hearing. Several new factors would weigh against asylum, including failure to pay taxes. Criminal records would still count against an asylum-seeker even if their convictions were expunged.  Asylum is to protect people from persecution on grounds of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, a loose category that may include victims of gang or domestic violence.  The regulations say gang members shouldn't be considered part of a social group if they were ever recruited or targeted by gangs or because they live in country with generalized violence. The definition of 'political opinion' is also more narrowly construed.  Michael Hethmon, senior counsel for the Immigration Reform Law Institute, thinks his letter was among the few supporting the rules out of 79,339 public comments.  Herthmon wrote that most of the comments he reviewed 'appear to be repetitive mass mailings' and that 'comprehensive reform of current dysfunctional practices is urgently needed.\"  Trump's critics are hoping he trips over the Administrative Procedure Act, enacted in 1946 as a check on presidential power in the wake of Franklin D. Roosevelt's expansive New Deal. It requires agencies to give reasoned explanations for their actions and refrain from \"arbitrary and capricious' behavior.  The U.S. Supreme Court last month refused to let the Trump administration scrap DACA, citing a failure to follow procedures outlined in the 1946 law. Last year, the court prohibited a census question about citizenship for similar reasons.  New York University School of Law's Institute for Policy Integrity says the Trump administration has succeeded on only 11 of 99 legal challenges to its regulatory changes, with more than half its losses on environmental policy.  Bethany Davis Noll, who manages the scorecard, said success rates in previous administrations hovered around 70%.  Christopher Walker, a professor at The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law, said the Trump administration's aggressive approach is partly to blame for its relative lack of success in court.  Walker also said targeting the proposed immigration rules with a massive public comment campaign wasn't realistic because the administration doesn't have to consider repeat statements. The objective should be to build a record that demonstrates the government failed to consider alternatives.  'It's not as much the quantity as the quality,' he said.

Indian and Chinese nationals would be exempt meaning they would still be allowed to earn a green card through employment. Currently, the law states that of 140,000 green cards issued through employment a year, there is a cap of 7 percent of the green cards per country. According to the State Department, India, China, and the Phillippines have the longest application lines with India’s stretching for more than half a century.  SB 386 would allow for more people from certain countries to obtain green cards through employment. To be exact, the bill would eliminate the 7 percent limit entirely. However, the language excludes all but two countries on the planet. This would mean that cities like Miami that rely heavily on employing people from Latin America would suffer and struggle to compete globally.

Despite increasing anxiety about coronavirus, for many of us, it was the first time we had encountered such a request. Underneath the words was a small image of two disembodied hands shaking, surrounded by a red circle struck through with a diagonal line.  Refraining from such a common behaviour was easier said than done. Handshaking comes automatically to many of us. The art of a proper handshake was drummed into me at a young age when growing up in the United States. When I was around ten years old, my father would rehearse my handshake with me: “Make eye contact first. You don’t want to shake hands like a dead fish.” So I gripped his hand as firmly as I could, my little wrist and fingers straining with pressure, my eyes locked on his.  Since then, I’ve become fascinated with the choreography of the handshake: steady eye contact, slight head nod in acknowledgement, slight step forward, extension of the right hand in one fluid movement before grasping your partner’s hand with just the right amount of pressure.  © Erika Hughes , Author provided   Hearty good will  The handshake has long been understood as a gesture that establishes a positive connection between two people. It’s one of the first gestures mentioned in Henry Siddons’s 1807 Practical Illustrations of Rhetorical Gesture and Action, a manual of gestures designed for English actors that was an adaptation of a classic earlier text, Ideen zu Einer Mimik (1785), by Johann Jacob Engel of the National Theatre Berlin.  Siddons defines the handshake, an action that “joins two extremities of the human body to each other”, as:  An expression usual in friendship, benevolence, and salutation. This gesture is rich in signification, for the hand is the tongue of hearty good will.  But what do we do when the formerly benevolent handshake becomes potentially dangerous? Angela Merkel’s interior minister Horst Seehofer recently rebuffed the German chancellor’s extended hand, while Italians, reeling from the highest numbers of infections in Europe, are trying out new rules of social engagement that represent a drastic departure from their high-contact normal social gestures of kissing and embrace.  But perhaps the most extreme example comes from Denmark, where naturalisation ceremonies have been suspended because a handshake has been a legally mandated part of the ceremony since a conservative change to the law in 2018. Widely criticised at the time as an anti-immigration initiative, the law is now making hundreds wait for Danish citizenship because of the pandemic.  Does this all spell the beginning of the end of hand-shaking?   Teaching without touching  I wondered about this as I walked into a conference room at the aforementioned handshake-free event where I was to teach an improvisation workshop for drama teachers, many of whom had considerable acting experience. I had planned to lead several exercises that involved touch, including one where the participants support the weight of one another’s bodies as a means to understand their relationship as a group. Another began with a series of handshakes exchanged throughout the room.  Before we began, I decided to ask participants whether they felt comfortable touching one another. Most didn’t mind – but some did, so I adapted the workshop to remove all direct contact that might, to echo Siddons, join the human body together. I asked participants to work in groups as originally planned, but mime the handshake (and other such gestures) with a gap between their bodies.   Salvatore di Nolfi/EPA-EFE  The removal of touch had a palpable impact on the workshop, as participants struggled to maintain the gap and resist the impulse to touch one another. The German dramatist Bertolt Brecht recognised the power of performance to make the familiar seem strange – what he famously termed the Verfremdungseffekt – thereby revealing that which is hiding in plain sight of society. Indeed, the shift in focus made the familiar handshake seem strange; removing the element of touch called attention to its ubiquity within common gestures.  Replacing the handshake with a representation increased the group’s awareness of the learned impulse to perform collegiality with one another. People kept apologising for not touching one another.   What comes after?  The coronavirus outbreak is causing people to rethink the handshake and seek other gestures that perform similar functions without touch. The news site India Today has advocated the replacement of the (western) handshake and cheek kiss in favour of a return to the traditional namaste greeting: a slight bow with hands pressed together. Besides noting its hygienic advantages, the article championed the desi (local to the Indian subcontinent) nature of this form.  This global health crisis calls into question the role of touch in culturally specific gestures of greeting and expressions of connection. Removing the assumption that we will probably touch one another fundamentally changes the repertoire of gestures we have at our disposal. The request to “refrain from hand shaking” has the potential to significantly re-script how we perform our relationships to one another.  A global response might result in moving toward new performed gestures that redefine how we interact with one another.

This team of reporters identified more than 100 cases of abuse involving 280 victims in 31 states. A powerful and high-impact investigation prompted by one reporter asking: How often does this happen?   Finalists  “Polluted by Money,” The Oregonian/OregonLive  Link to The Oregonian series  Judges’ comments: A smart, well-executed investigation of the role that the lax regulation of campaign contributions by corporations and industry groups has played in state environmental regulators’ failure to address pollution problems.  “Big Spending, Little Accountability,” The Caucus and Spotlight PA  Link to Spotlight PA first story  Judges’ comments: Undeterred by vague descriptions of campaign expenditures made on credit cards and through self-reimbursement, this ingenious investigation used a little-known provision in state law to obtain receipts kept in the candidates’ own files and reveal campaign cash being used for foreign travel, expensive dinners and other personal perks.   PRINT/ONLINE — Division IV   Winner  “It’s Time For You to Die,” The Post and Courier, Jennifer Berry Hawes, Stephen Hobbs, Glenn Smith, Andrew Whitaker, Seanna Adcox  Link to The Post and Courier first story  Judges’ comments: This was a beautifully written example of accountability journalism that took great pains to examine a deadly explosion of violence that broke out in a rural South Carolina prison. The reporters painstakingly reconstructed for readers the violence, hour by hour, using information they obtained by writing to more than 400 inmates. The result was an important and inspirational work of journalism that examined a topic few people pay attention to on a daily basis.   Finalist  “Disabilities Claims Denied,” The Tennessean  Link to The Tennessean first story  Judges’ comments: The Tennessean took on an underreported and little-known practice among some Tennessee doctors. Physicians can make hundreds of thousands of dollars reviewing disability claims for those seeking federal benefits. The investigation found that how much doctors earn depends on how fast they work—one doctor was reviewing on average one claim every 12 minutes. Experts interviewed by the Tennessean said it’s impossible to review the claims so quickly. Statewide, 72 percent of claims were denied, topping the national average of 66 percent.  “Taken,” The Greenville News and Anderson Independent Mail  Link to The Greenville News series  Judges’ comments: While civil forfeitures aren’t a new topic, reporters at the News took a fresh approach to explaining how law enforcement officials use the practice to take millions of dollars from people, many of whom have committed no crime. The series also examined the racial dynamics of the practices, showing how African Americans in the state are disproportionately affected. The newspapers should be commended for taking the first-ever look at the practice of police forces taking property from people in the state.  “El Mencho’s American Empire,” The Courier-Journal  Link to The Courier-Journal first story  Judges’ comments: A critically important investigation into the operations of a major Mexican drug cartel operating throughout the United States. The investigation is an important reminder that the international drug trade is not just over there, but happening in the backyards of those in small towns miles from the border.   BROADCAST/VIDEO — Division I   Winner  “Syria Health Care Under Attack,” The New York Times, Malachy Browne, Whitney Hurst, Evan Hill, Christiaan Triebert, Dmitriy Khavin  Link to The New York Times story  Judges’ comments: This unique and revelatory story never would have been told and these horrific acts would have remained concealed if not for the incredible, innovative work done by this team. They utilized cutting-edge techniques and digital tools to harness open-source information and pieced it together to expose damning evidence. Excellent sourcing and compelling video helped convey the reality of what happened to these hospitals and who was responsible.   Finalist  “Flint’s Deadly Water,” PBS Frontline  Link to PBS Frontline story  Judges’ comments: Great shoe-leather reporting to advance a story that had wide coverage, but in a different way. Their groundbreaking work examining death records revealed a death toll higher than official numbers showed and revealed it through the voices of compelling victims. We commend them for digging back in on a lesser-known and deadlier aspect of the Flint water crisis and exposing the Legionnaires’ disease impact.

Link to WBBM-TV story  Judges’ comments: CBS 2 investigators exposed a shocking pattern of Chicago police mistakenly raiding the homes of innocent people and traumatizing children, who in some cases were handcuffed and had guns pointed at them. Despite the Chicago Police Department’s refusal to release records on how often these wrong raids occur, these journalists doggedly revealed case after troubling case, prompting a city inspector general investigation and the passage of a new law that requires police to be trained on how children experience trauma.   Finalist  “Mission Critical,” KARE 11, Minneapolis  Link to KARE 11 story  Judges’ comments: An important, ongoing investigation of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs that has prompted hundreds of millions of dollars in refunds owed to disabled veterans, reforms in the way the agency handles emergency medical claims and life-saving medical treatment for one Minnesota veteran who had previously been denied a transplant.   BROADCAST/VIDEO — Division III   Winner  “Fooling the Feds,” Fox45 News, Baltimore, Jeff Keene, Chris Papst, Carolyn Sachse, Dwayne Myers, Jed Gamber  Link to Fox45 News story  Judges’ comments: This is a textbook example of a local television station holding local officials accountable. When a charter school in Baltimore got a $1.5 million grant from the federal government to teach low-income students, the decision was widely praised. But two years later, the school shut down. WBFF wanted to know why and dug deep into the school’s application to the federal government. The findings were shocking: The man at the center of school’s application had misrepresented several key factors in the application, claiming more students than there actually were, providing inaccurate test scores and even claiming locations for schools that were never built.   Finalist  “Bargaining the Badge: How Hundreds of Accused Texas Officers Avoid Prison,” KXAN-TV, Austin   Link to KXAN-TV story  Judges’ comments: This impressive investigation offered a rare look inside a practice largely unknown by the public. The reporters found that nearly 300 former law enforcement officers in Texas had surrendered their license after being accused of serious crimes including sexual assault, abusing prisoners and taking bribes. But these officers were able to largely walk away without being charged by using their badges as a bargaining chip: They would give up their badge to avoid prosecution. The reporters are to be commended for digging into this little-known topic.   BROADCAST/VIDEO — Division IV   Winner  “Patient Pain: The Massive Money in Medical Debt,” East Idaho News, Nate Eaton, Nate Sunderland, Mike Price  Link to East Idaho News story  Judges’ comments: These reporters did an excellent job explaining a very complicated issue and obtained strong results for their community. Their effort to tell the stories of real people was commendable, as was their resolve to thoroughly investigate every aspect of how the company operates and hold the attorney accountable.   Finalist  “Pattern of Secrecy,” WLBT, Jackson, MS   Link to WLBT story  Judges’ comments: WLBT exhibited incredible strength to stand up for accountability in a small community, even when the news organization depends on that police agency for its daily news coverage. The spirit and resolve to stop public officials from misleading the public is commendable.   RADIO/AUDIO – LARGE   Winner  “Amazon: Behind the Smiles,” Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, Will Evans, Katharine Mieszkowski, Taki Telonidis, Rachel de Leon, Kevin Sullivan, Najib Aminy, Andrew Donohue, Esther Kaplan, Matt Thompson, John Barth (PRX), Al Letson, Melissa Lewis, Hannah Young, Byard Duncan, David Rodriguez, Mwende Hinojosa, Jim Briggs, Fernando Arruda   Link to Reveal story  Judges’ comments: This was just amazing work. Labor reporters have become dinosaurs at so many news organizations, and it’s inspiring to see this dogged storytelling. Reveal and PRX went through impressive lengths to get information on injuries that both Amazon and OSHA wanted hidden. And the revelations about Amazon truly penetrated the public’s consciousness about a company that’s become ubiquitous in American life. Our jaws were on the floor before the 5-minute mark. Bravo.   Finalists  “Children Are Routinely Isolated In Some Fairfax County Schools. The District Didn’t Report It,” WAMU 88.5 – Washington, D.C.  Link to WAMU 88.5 first story  Judges’ comments: This was a great investigation that had significant impact and is the definition of a local outlet punching way, way above its weight. The work made a huge difference for a vulnerable population.  “Caregivers and Takers,” Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting, PRX, PBS Newshour, and the Associated Press  Link to Reveal story; Link to PBS Newshour story; Link to Associated Press story  Judges’ comments: At a time when senior care is an ever-important topic, this investigation took on a surprising angle and found millions in stolen wages through difficult and impressive analysis of public records. And yet, the piece also tied in excellent real person storytelling.   RADIO/AUDIO – SMALL   Winner  “Prosecution Declined,” Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting, Eleanor Klibanoff, Kate Howard, Laura Ellis  Link to the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting story  Judges’ comments: A wonderful example of clear and compelling storytelling that made great use of data and audio. These reporters took a topic that might otherwise be hard to digest and wrapped it into a story that drew the listener in.   Finalists  “Worse for Care,” Vermont Public Radio and Seven Days  Link to Vermont Public Radio story  Judges’ comments: Reporters did an excellent job taking a widely known topic one step further. Particularly well done was its use of a central character that really articulated the issues of elder abuse, finding a way to humanize and give voice to victims.  “A 911 Emergency,” The Public’s Radio – Rhode Island  Link to The Public’s Radio story  Judges’ comments: This story offered riveting storytelling. The reporters exhibited exceptional initiative in getting data and 911 audio and using it to tell a compelling story.   STUDENT – LARGE   Winner  “State of Emergency,” Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, Arizona State University, News21 staff   Link to News21 series  Judges’ comments: This team’s work had a lot of scope, sweep and polish that’s admirable for a student project. They did an excellent job finding real stories, real people and bringing a nationwide focus to an issue that’s critical to so many communities in a vulnerable time of need. What could have been a boring data story about communities coping with smaller disasters was transformed into a compelling multimedia experience.   Finalist  “The Maternity Divide,” CUNY Newmark Graduate School of Journalism  Link to NYCity News Service series  Judges’ comments: These student journalists put together an impressive, multimedia presentation about maternal health disparities. Great job drilling down into a single New York hospital’s troubles and showing the impact of heartbreaking missteps.   STUDENT – SMALL   Winner  “Believe at your own risk,” SUNY Stony Brook, Rachael Eyler  Link to SUNY Stony Brook series  Judges’ comments: While not a traditional investigative project, this story was extremely innovative and compelling. The reporter made effective use of in-depth interviews with experts and real people, along with cutting-edge reporting techniques. The entry made many of the judges want to do the same story.   Finalist  “In Missouri’s juvenile justice system, kids restrain other kids,” The Columbia Missourian and KOMU 8 News  Link to The Columbia Missourian story; Link to KOMU 8 story  Judges’ comments: This reporter did solid investigative reporting to show what was happening in Missouri’s juvenile justice system: kids used to restrain other kids. The investigation held officials accountable for policies that injured children.  INVESTIGATIONS TRIGGERED BY BREAKING NEWS   Winner  “Inside Texas’ Botched Voter-Rolls Review,” The Texas Tribune, Alexa Ura  Link to The Texas Tribune first story  Judges’ comments: The Tribune showed courageous, consistent coverage on a breaking, hot-button topic. It was written with authority in real time and made effective use of data. The stories challenged state officials on practices that disenfranchised the state’s most vulnerable voters. The stories yielded results, including the resignation of the Texas Secretary of State and congressional investigations.   Finalists  “Almost Forbidden,” Los Angeles Times  Link to Los Angeles Times story  Judges’ comments: As vaping-related youth nicotine addiction surged across the United States, the Times showed that years earlier the FDA tried to ban flavored e-cigarettes, but top Obama Administration officials rejected the plan after pressure from tobacco industry lobbyists and small business advocates. The reporter got up to speed on a new topic quickly and executed an important investigation driven by documents and data.  “How America’s College-Closure Crisis Leaves Families Devastated,” The Chronicle of Higher Education  Link to Chronicle of Higher Education story  Judges’ comments: This investigation showed how an industry with a long history of problems and little oversight impacted thousands of students. This quick-turn project used strong data-driven reporting and beautiful narrative to tell the stories of those affected by the sudden closure of a chain of for-profit colleges.  IRE Award for Sports Investigations   Winner  “Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel: Game Change,” HBO, Josh Fine, Bernie Goldberg, Nisreen Habbal, Tres Driscoll, Joe Perskie   Link to HBO story  Judges’ comments: We applaud the gutsy approach this team used to statistically analyze which communities are still playing tackle football and analyze the makeup of the team from a racial and socioeconomic perspective. This groundbreaking research advanced the conversation surrounding CTE exposure in a meaningful way and revealed the impact on an at-risk community. This was a particularly commendable feat undertaken by an organization that has a significant relationship with the NFL.   Finalists  “We’re going to need a bigger net: Foul balls hurt hundreds of fans at MLB ballparks,” NBC News  Link to NBC News story  Judges’ comments: This investigation will have lasting effects on thousands of people who go to baseball games who may never have realized they were in danger. This team packed a lot of work into a short piece — from compelling personal stories to the player perspective, use of FOIA and data work. The immediate results from one team, followed by action from all of Major League Baseball, is a commendable achievement.  “Pimlico Fight,” The Baltimore Sun  Link to The Baltimore Sun first story  Judges’ comments: This entry took sports reporting to another level by examining the financial records to prove that accountability and oversight were lacking. The reporter did a good job chipping away at the story and connecting all of the pieces to achieve measurable results.   BOOK   Winner  “Bottle of Lies: The Inside Story of the Generic Drug Boom,” by Katherine Eban  Judges’ comments: Eban goes beyond her previous book, “Dangerous Doses: A True Story of Cops, Counterfeiters, and the Contamination of America’s Drug Supply” to uncover the world-wide scandal surrounding the manufacture and marketing of generic pharmaceuticals. Generics, usually less expensive for consumers than brand-name pharmaceuticals, account for about 90 percent of sales in the USA. Eban demonstrates that numerous generics are adulterated with unsanitary material, fail to function in patients as advertised, and sometimes are partially implicated in premature death. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is sometimes part of the scandal, rather than an effective watchdog. During her multi-continent reporting, Eban benefitted from cooperation provided by the Global Investigative Journalism Network and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.   Finalist  “Citizen 865: The Hunt for Hitler’s Hidden Soldiers in America,” by Debbie Cenziper  Judges’ comments: Although the crimes against humanity covered in the book are historical, many of the sleuths seeking justice for the dead are very much contemporary. Cenziper enters the minds of the justice seekers inside and outside government. As the narrative unfolds, Cenziper offers a police procedural beyond the boundaries of usual detective work.

This story was originally published on Newsroom.co.nz and is republished with permission.  Major operations around the country to provide food aid to struggling migrants are being withdrawn as coronavirus alert levels drop.  Auckland Emergency Management's (AEM) contact line for Covid-19 food parcel enquiries will be cut off by the end of the week, as will other Civil Defence Emergency Management contact lines.  While AEM has been in operation, 56,000 food parcels have been provided to over 16,500 households in Auckland.  A migrant Newsroom spoke to, Kate*, who was once given a small set of rations for her family of seven - including a can of beans - was handed $250 a week in Pak N' Save food vouchers after the story's publication.  Auckland Council via Newsroom Civil Defence Emergency Management support is being scaled back now the country is at level 1.  * Coronavirus: Weekly $490 payments for unemployed workers in $1.2b Government relief scheme  * Coronavirus: The desperation of Queenstown's migrant workers  * Queenstown workers feel trapped after job losses  She is one of 150 foreigners in Auckland to get this support and has been assured it will continue despite CDEM support being withdrawn.  Minister for Social Development Carmel Sepuloni said: \"CDEM continues to provide support for foreign nationals in the short term and we are continuing to look at other options moving forward\".  AEM Group Controller Kate Crawford said: \"The time has now come to scale back our response.\"  “As Aotearoa has moved down the alert levels, the demand for our welfare services has reduced.\"  However, the needs of people like Paras Gupta - who has been here nine years and lost his job just before lockdown - only seem to be increasing.  He isn't living on the streets like he once was, but he is down to his last $9.  Gupta isn't eligible for a benefit so Civil Defence support through regional Civil Defence Emergency Management organisations, such as AEM (funded by the Government, but administered through councils and territorial authorities), are the main government lifeline he can access.  AEM's major operation at Spark Arena to send out food boxes to vulnerable families will pack up on Friday.  Anyone who wants to contact AEM will have to go through the normal council contact centre where they will be redirected to different agencies or to an independent food bank in the community.  For foreigners, \"embassies and consulates should continue to be the first point of call\", Crawford said.  The Social Security Act allows migrants to be granted emergency benefits during an epidemic.  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has agreed on the need to come up with a long-term solution for these migrants beyond food parcel support.  Getty Images Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern agrees long-term solutions are needed.  NZ First MP Shane Jones has said any form of benefit to help them out would be a hard sell to his caucus, even if it were a stepping stone to a one-way ticket home.  If migrants have been fired from their jobs they often can't take up new jobs because of their visa conditions.  The passage of a new immigration law has made it possible for the Immigration Minister to change those conditions en masse, but he hasn't done so yet.  Mangere East Family Services CEO Peter Sykes said the problem was much bigger than those cases that made the headlines or even those who reached out for assistance through official channels.  \"Now these people are seen as sort of transitory - it's like it's their fault - but we brought them here.  \"The most vulnerable people I don't think benefited from any of the food parcels or packages because they're probably not on anybody's lists.\"  'AFTER THAT I'M JUST STUCK AGAIN'  Gupta has lived here for nine years and been on a work visa - and paying taxes - since 2013.  He spent most of those years criss-crossing between regions.  First the Manawatū, then Wellington and New Plymouth. He was in the middle of moving to Auckland for another job when lockdown hit and he found himself stranded in a new city.  Newsroom reported he spent the first week of lockdown living on the street because the backpackers he was staying at wasn't allowed to house him.  Kevin Stent/Stuff NZ First MP Shane Jones has said more help for migrants would be hard to sell to his party.  After that brief period of homelessness, Gupta found a house where the landlord was willing to accept $150 a week in rent - much less than the usual $350 - until he found a new tenant.  Now lockdown has lifted, new tenants have been found and he's had to move into a $78-a-night Central Auckland backpackers which he has prepaid for two weeks.  \"After that I'm just stuck again.\"  To have a shot at surviving, he'll need a new job. That won't come until the Government grants him a new work visa tied to a different region.  Normally, moving to a new region would simply be a matter of getting Immigration New Zealand to approve a variation of conditions on a work visa (he's done it several times before).  This time he's been told he will need to apply for a completely new visa.  That has further eaten into his savings: a variation to visa conditions costs $195, a new work visa $495.  So, he will have to stretch that $9 for as long as he can.  Otherwise, he'll have to use his parents' credit card from India and they'll have to find some way to pay it off as Covid-19 rampages through their country.  Stuff Thousands of migrant workers, who are now unemployed in Queenstown, want the chance to work and rebuild their lives. (Video first published on May 22, 2020)   PROBLEMS BEYOND FOOD  Kate and her family are also waiting for a work visa application to be approved. Her husband used to work as a digger and has a job, but has to get visa approval to take it.  \"It's gone onto Level 1 now so there may be less chances of them helping us anymore.\"  She said the $250 a week in food vouchers had been a big help, but confirmed it was strictly limited to buying food.  \"When I'm given food vouchers that means I can't buy gas from them ... so I just asked them if they are able to provide me with some cooking gas because what am I going to do with the groceries when I have no cooking gas?\"  Food is also shaping up to be the least of her problems. Her bank account has already been suspended because she's in overdraft, and she hasn't paid the rent in more than 10 weeks.  Rent is $350 per week so the seven of them can live in a cold and mouldy converted garage.  Peter Fowler/RNZ The Union Network of Migrants says there's also a labour shortage in the horticulture sector as well.  WAITING TO BE KICKED OUT  She placated her landlord - their rent covers power and water - by saying she had applied to the Government for some sort of financial assistance to pay rent. That was true, but she'd also received a notice her application had been rejected.  \"I'm just too worried if the landlord doesn't kick us out of the house saying 'See you're using power, water, my house and you're paying nothing'.\"  Mangere East Family Services social worker Heidi San Juan has been trying to help Kate. CDEM support was being provided differently in different regions.  While AEM wouldn't help Kate out with rent, other CDEM organisations in the South Island had done just that in similar cases to Kate's.  The problem wasn't just that Kate isn't able to access an emergency benefit, but that her husband hasn't received visa approval to take up the construction job he's already been hired for.  Union Network of Migrants spokesman Mandeep Bela said the \"sensible\" thing for the Government to do was use new visa powers to grant migrants the ability to switch employers, industries and regions so they could earn enough money to survive.  \"There's a lot of labour shortage in the horticulture sector as well, healthcare, construction ... they'll help the economy as well. They'll help the migrant workers as well. They'll help everybody.\"  Kate's ultimate hope is that his visa application will be granted before their landlord moves on any eviction plans.  \"I have a feeling she [the landlord will] give me a notice of eviction. That's what I'm scared of.\"  *Kate asked that an alias be used.  This story was originally published on Newsroom.co.nz and is republished with permission.

Trump crossed that line today with his unprecedented comments — repeated both in a news conference during his embarrassing visit to India and in a tweet that memorialized his attacks in text — demanding that Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg recuse themselves from any cases involving him or his administration because of their supposed bias against him.  Despite his foreign travels, the president still manages to keep up to date on the latest vitriol being spewed by Fox News right-wing rageaholics, so the source of his animus towards Justice Sotomayor is clear as his tweet made it plainly apparent that his misinterpretation of the Bronx-born Supreme Court jurist’s dissenting opinion — criticizing Trump’s now-servile Justice Department for being too quick to turn to the Supreme Court for reversals of lower court losses ruling on the administration’s oft-unconstitutional policies and bypassing standard appellate procedure to get an immediate stay from a Supreme Court now filled with a majority of conservative justices — came straight from that harridan of thoughtful legal analysis, Laura Ingraham.  ….on all Trump, or Trump related, matters! While “elections have consequences”, I only ask for fairness, especially when it comes to decisions made by the United States Supreme Court! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2020  Apparently neither Ingraham — who with a law degree should know better — nor Trump is familiar with Supreme Court procedure or deliberations since they fail to understand that it is the entire purpose of a panel of jurists to discuss the law in a particular case, exchange opinions, and convince their colleagues of the superiority of their interpretation of the relevant law and precedent.   Sponsored Links  Saying that “elections have consequences,” the president ignores both the politically-motivated theft of his predecessor President Obama’s ability to have his own choice considered for the Supreme Court seat available after the death of arch-conservative Justice Antonin Scalia by the scheming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell but also the non-partisan nature of a court that is supposedly insulated from the day-to-day flux of political winds.   Sponsored Links  Not content with a mere Twitter rant displaying his ignorance and his selfish insistence that his own force of will dominates in pushing his heartless, heinous immigration policies and other controversial legislation prematurely pushed to the nation’s top court, Trump reiterated his attacks on Justice Sotomayor in a press conference this morning in New Delhi.   Sponsored Links  “Her statement was so inappropriate,” Trump said. “When you’re a justice of the Supreme Court — it’s almost what she’s trying is take the people who do feel a different way and get them to vote the way that she would like them to vote. I just thought it was so inappropriate, such a terrible statement for a Supreme Court statement.”  Apparently, however, the president never bothered reading exactly what Justice Sotomayor actually wrote in her dissenting opinion — which was careful not to attribute any political motivations to her fellow justices who have consistently decided in favor of the Trump administration, although they likely deserve the accusations of partisanship.  When asked by Fox News John Roberts exactly what was inappropriate about Justice Sotomayor’s words, Trump resorted to a dodge familiar to anyone dealing with someone who doesn’t have an actual clue about the topic upon which they are bloviating, claiming that everyone knows what he what he’s talking about while refusing to answer the question in any substantive way.  “You know what the statement was,” Trump replied to the journalist. When Roberts subsequently repeated an accurate summary of Sotomayor’s dissent, the president dismissed him with a curt rejoinder: “No, I don’t think that was it.”  You can watch a clip of Trump’s continued attacks on the Supreme Court and the latest episode in his persistent attacks on the rule of law in this nation — a rule to which he obviously believes that he is immune from being obligated to be subject — in the excerpt from his press conference in India below.  Trump, during news conference in India, explains that he thinks Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg should recuse herself from cases involving him because she didn't support him in 2016. He also calls on Justice Sotomayor to recuse herself for an unspecified \"inappropriate\" statement. pic.twitter.com/fb0WqOXKvp — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 25, 2020  Trump is also likely using the attack to muddy the waters as a true conflict of interest plays out with his allies. A so-called “deep state” enemies list has been prepared for Trump by conservative activists, including Ginni Thomas, wife of Justice Clarence Thomas. This presents a troubling issue of a Justice’s family entangling in the activities of a separate branch and a man who has ample business before the Court.  By going after liberal justices in the same week, Trump is creating the illusion that this is happening on both sides. It is incumbent on us to ensure that the American people don’t fall for it.  In the interest of full disclosure, it should be noted that the author attended high school with Justice Sotomayor from 1968-1972, although they have not been in touch since then.

On March 13, he said: “I don’t take responsibility at all.” On April 13, a month later, he declared: “I have the ultimate authority” to order states to relax social distancing to combat the coronavirus outbreak and reopen their economies. He went on to claim his authority in this regard was “total.” He warned that governors who refuse would face political consequences.   ADVERTISEMENT  Asked what provision of the Constitution gives him the power to open or close state economies, Trump said: “Numerous provisions. We’ll give you a legal brief if you want.” Most lawyers would have difficulty writing such a brief or finding the “numerous provisions” the president was unable to elaborate.  Trump’s position raised some conservative eyebrows. Traditionally, Democrats have favored a strong central government, while Republicans, fearing socialization and the abuse inherent in a centralized infrastructure, have favored states’ rights. As Ronald Reagan put it, the “government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.”  On April 16, Trump switched positions and said not he, but the governors would “call the shots,” even though he claimed, as reported in The Hill, that he had the authority to “overrule” them.  Finally, in an April 17 tweet, he undercut the Democratic governors of Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia by issuing a clarion call to anti-lockdown citizens, in many cases suspiciously organized by pro-Trump conservative activists, to “liberate” their states (and, in the case of Virginia with a reference to the Second Amendment, even by force of arms). Such statements implicate Title 18, U.S.C. § 2385, which criminalizes conduct that advocates and advises the overthrow of a state government by force and violence. Conservative undermining of what the governors are trying to do to save lives and end the spread is exemplified by the demand of firebrand Republican Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio that governors continuing the lockdown should be “investigated.” Indeed, Attorney General William Barr, who thinks Americans should not be “hiding under their bed,” has threatened legal action against the governors for civil rights violations, stating that stay at home orders are “disturbingly close to house arrest.” Well, as Hamlet said, “the devil can cite scripture for his purpose.”  Trump understandably, like most Americans, wants to re-open the country as soon as possible. But his priorities are political, social and economic, and if he gets his way to the exclusion of everything else there will be needless loss of life. Even with this in mind, it is sheer lunacy to prevent the governors from doing the very job he asked them to do. He has unduly politicized the issue of authority. By deferring to the governors, he can opportunistically blame them if they open too early, and there is more spread, more deaths, and more lockdown. But, if the governors succeed, he can cast himself in an election year as the “recovery president,” whose May 1 program for “Opening Up America again” (sound familiar?) turned out to be a great success or, to use one of his favorite adjectives, “perfect.” Governors are split in their approach to reopening with the cleavage largely along party lines. Republican governors are swiftly moving to reopen key sectors; Democrats are moving more slowly. States and cities may have different rules — a reflection of how many new cases are on the ground, as well as demographic and political fault lines.   ADVERTISEMENT  There is of course a downside in a national crisis of leaving it all to the locals. The central government must work closely with the states to achieve workable rules for regions and industries based on reason, and as much as Trump dislikes it, the science. Resources must be allocated fairly in accordance with need, not politics. Contrary to what Trump says, he must indeed be a kind of “shipping clerk,” not “President Bountiful,” distributing political largesse only to the grateful and the faithful.  Trump has been politically opportunistic in another area as well. The crisis feeds his xenophobic position that immigrants have taken jobs away from Americans and constitute a burden on social services, a position belied by the impressively low unemployment numbers he gloated about before the coronavirus became more serious than the common cold. In addition, the burden of prohibiting foreign workers in the United States will not fall on the foreigners so much as on the small business employers in the United States, who rely on such workers for their survival. Here, he must tread lightly. Immigrants are numerous in essential occupations ranging from physicians to healthcare workers to pharmacists. So, by executive order, he proposes to bar new immigrants to the country, even if they are family members of U.S. citizens. The proposed order, as now appears, will only reaffirm what is already in place. As the Wall Street Journal points out, “even without an executive order, the administration has already all but ceased every form of immigration.” The proposed order will inevitably have some notable exemptions: temporary residents on green cards, high-skilled foreigners here on three-year visas who come to work, and migrant farm workers.  The founders of our country were wisely suspicious of a strong central government. The 10th Amendment to the Constitution reserves for states all powers that aren’t specifically granted to the federal government. Chief Justice John Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden (1824) recognized an “immense mass” of lawmaking power, where states retain primacy, “not surrendered to the federal government.” His examples were “inspection laws, quarantine laws, and health laws of every description.” Constitutional lawyers call this residuum of sovereign power the police power.   ADVERTISEMENT  Congress has given the president has broad powers in the case of a pandemic. Under the Public Health Service Act, he can prevent spread of communicable disease from “one state…into any other state.” Under the Defense Production Act, he is authorized to accomplish “emergency preparedness,” and “critical infrastructure protection and restoration.” The Supreme Court has said that when the president acts to carry out broad authority delegated to him by Congress, he is at the “high-water mark in the voluntary surrender of liberty.”  But, those powers are limited by the states’ police power. Trump better get his signals straight. There is too much at stake, and we cannot become a failed dysfunctional state. L’état c’est moi went out with Louis XIV. And certainly not where we have at latest count upwards of 800,000 cases and close to 45,000 deaths.   ADVERTISEMENT  State and local governments are where the rubber meets the road in deciding when and how to reopen the country. When can we reopen the schools, surely a major priority? Until we do, how can Americans begin to go back to work? When will we have tested an adequate sampling of the population to reach a conclusion in which the public can have confidence? All questions for the governors and mayors throughout the country.  Will we all be at the Super Bowl next February in Tampa? Perhaps a sobering idea, but that will be up to Governor DeSantis of Florida.  James D.

We did not then; we do not now.\"  Elected officials and immigrant advocates in Chicago are voicing their opposition to the Trump administration's latest crackdown on sanctuary cities. These are localities that refuse to help ICE identify and arrest undocumented immigrants.  Border Patrol is sending 100 officers — including elite tactical units known as BORTAC — to help ICE conduct arrests in the country's interior. BORTAC agents typically conduct high-risk missions against cartels and human traffickers along the border. But from February through May, some BORTAC agents will be deployed in sanctuary cities nationwide, including in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago.

We're not going to change our tactics or escalate our use of force.\" On top of that, ICE's acting director says it's using the agents \"to supplement enforcement activity in response to the resource challenges stemming from sanctuary city policies.\"  \"To the lawmakers who support non-cooperation with ICE, please reconsider your position so that we can jointly prevent dangerous individuals like murderers, gang members, rapists, pedophiles, drug dealers and domestic abusers from being released back into our communities who are in violation of federal immigration law.\"  The city of Chicago prevents local police from cooperating with ICE unless the targeted individuals have pending or prior felony convictions, an outstanding criminal warrant or have been certified as a gang member. And the state of Illinois forbids counties from transferring undocumented people they jail to ICE custody unless ICE presents a judicial warrant. ICE says these policies greatly hurt agents' abilities to do their job, hence the need for additional resources.  But Chicago officials say cooperating with ICE would undermine the trust of immigrant communities and thereby make their city less safe.  \"When victims and witnesses are afraid to come to court because they believe that there's the potential for ICE agents to scoop them and tear them from their families, then they simply stop participating.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 12, "positive": 11, "negative": 5, "joy": 1, "anger": 10, "surprise": 1, "fear": 12, "trust": 4}, "metadata": ["sanctuary", "state's", "engage", "advocates", "chicago", "trump", "administration's", "crackdown", "undocumented", "tactical", "arrests", "country's", "los", "angeles", "calling", "census", "spokesperson", "ice's", "resource", "challenges", "lawmakers", "immigration", "targeted", "pending", "criminal", "illinois", "transferring", "custody", "hurt"]}, {"text": "Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield Photo: Getty Images  There are four new Covid cases in New Zealand today.  Two cases are in the community and two are in managed isolation, the Ministry of Health said in a statement.  The first community case is a close contact of an existing patient who has been epidemiologically linked to the cluster.  The second is a household contact of a confirmed case linked to the Mt Roskill 'mini cluster'.  The Auckland cluster now has 161 people linked to it.  With the four cases today, the total number of active cases is 118. Of those, 41 are imported cases in MIQ facilities, and 77 are community cases.  Of the two imported cases, the first is a boy under 4 and the second is a woman in her 20s.  Both arrived from India on August 23 and they are both a close contact of separate previously reported cases.  There have been a number of imported cases from that flight.  Four patients are in hospital today - one is in Waikato Hospital's ICU, the other three are stable.  The country's total number of confirmed cases is now 1425.  Today's statement confirmed that new rules for testing certain higher-risk workers at the border and in managed isolation and quarantine facilities are now in force.   These rules include:  • Workers at Managed Quarantine Facilities and workers who transport people required to be in quarantine to and from the facility will be tested once every seven days  • Workers at Managed Isolation Facilities and workers who transport people required to be in isolation to and from the facility will be tested once every 14 days  • Workers in certain higher-risk occupations at the Ports of Auckland and the Port of Tauranga will be tested once every 14 days  • Workers in certain higher-risk occupations at Auckland International Airport will be tested once every 14 days  Meanwhile, there are now 2,139,000 registered users of the Covid-19 tracer app - some 360,000 QR code posters have been created.  The app has recorded 43,433,462 poster scans, and 2,477,964 manual diary entries.  Since August 11, the ministry's contact tracing team has identified 3224 close contacts of cases, of which 3199 have been contacted and are self-isolating. The rest are in the process of being contacted.  The ministry processed just under 4000 Covid tests yesterday, bringing the total number of tests to 818,600.  The new cases brings the number of people linked to the community cluster who remain in the Auckland quarantine facility to 70.  That includes 52 people who have tested positive for Covid-19 and their household contacts.  There were five new cases of Covid-19 confirmed yesterday – four were in the community and one was in managed isolation.  All four were linked to the Auckland cluster and epidemiologically linked to the Mt Roskill Evangelical Church group.  Meanwhile, a Christchurch person who was on Saturday discussed as being under further investigation has now been confirmed as not a case of Covid-19.

We must prevent the abuse of benefits and services, remove immigration offenders and foreign national offenders from the UK and disrupt the organised crime groups that prey on the vulnerable. The UK also has a proud history of providing protection to those who need it, in accordance with our international obligations under the Refugee Convention and European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  The Immigration Rules already enable the status of undocumented migrants (in the UK for some time, and otherwise compliant with the law) to be regularised in some circumstances.  Migrants may make an application for leave to remain where there are grounds to do so. This will remain the case when the new points-based immigration system is implemented.  The current private life Immigration Rules provide a route for people to remain in the UK in certain circumstances. This includes:  For an adult who: has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20 years; is aged between 18 and 25 years and has spent at least half of their life living here; or, has lived continuously in the UK for less than 20 years, but there would be very significant obstacles to their integration into the country of return, or;  A child (under 18 years), who has lived continuously in the UK for seven years where it would not be reasonable for them to leave.  Furthermore, families can regularise their status under the family Immigration Rules where there is a qualifying partner or child (who is British or who has lived continuously in the UK for at least seven years) and it is unreasonable to expect family life to continue outside the UK or for the child to leave.  In addition to the immigration routes highlighted above, if appropriate in light of the situation in their country of origin, undocumented migrants may claim asylum. The UK will continue to uphold our obligations under the Refugee Convention, and the ECHR, during this time. Therefore, in relation to asylum claims, whilst ensuring that the Home Office is adhering to Public Health England’s advice in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak, claims can still be made, and decisions are continuing to be served on a case by case basis where there is sufficient evidence for us to make an accurate and well-informed decision in-line with published policy. Even if an asylum claim is refused, measures we have implemented guarantee that an individual can remain safely accommodated and able to follow public health guidance, whilst maintaining access to financial support and healthcare until the end of June, and this will be kept under review.  For those who do not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules, there is provision for a grant of leave where there are exceptional circumstances or compelling compassionate grounds which would mean refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant. Each application is considered on its merits, taking into account individual circumstances. This reflects our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  More information on the various immigration routes available to migrants in the UK can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-visas-and-immigration.  Should an undocumented migrant fail to meet the requirements of the various immigration routes available, and have no right to remain, then they should leave the UK. There is assistance available to help such individuals leave the UK, such as the Voluntary Returns Scheme. Allowing undocumented migrants to remain would result in an inability to have immigration control.  As a result of this, there are no plans for the Government to create a new amnesty route as requested by this petition.

Last month, a lower court ruling blocked Trump's push, calling a presidential memo that called for that unprecedented change unlawful. And now the justices have expedited consideration to hear oral arguments in the case on Nov. 30.  The hearing is set to take place a month before federal law says the latest state population counts for reapportioning the 435 seats in the House of Representatives among the states are due to the president. The timing increases the potential for Trump to try to make the change to who is included in the numbers during his current term in office.  Since the first U.S. census in 1790, the numbers of U.S. residents who are counted to determine each state's share of congressional seats have included both citizens and noncitizens, regardless of immigration status.  \"President Trump has repeatedly tried — and failed — to weaponize the census for his attacks on immigrant communities. The Supreme Court rejected his attempt last year and should do so again,\" said Dale Ho, a lead plaintiffs' attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who successfully argued against the now-blocked citizenship question the administration wanted on the 2020 census forms.  The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Federal law requires the president to deliver to Congress \"a statement showing the whole number of persons in each State\" based on the once-a-decade census.  In September, a lower federal court in Manhattan declared Trump's memo an illegal overreach of the president's limited authority, as delegated by Congress, over the census.  Even if the Supreme Court overturns that ruling, however, it is not clear if Trump would practically be able to exclude unauthorized immigrants from the results of this year's census. The 2020 forms did not include a question about a person's immigration status.  The U.S. Census Bureau could provide information about unauthorized immigrants in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers, according to a court filing.  But during a hearing Wednesday, Justice Department attorney John Coghlan told a federal court in Maryland, which is hearing a similar lawsuit over Trump's memo, that the administration does not know what other groups of unauthorized immigrants it could feasibly omit from the apportionment counts.  This week, the high court issued a ruling that allowed the administration to end counting for the census more than two weeks earlier than expected.  With a lone dissent by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the high court's order has paved a path for the bureau to try to meet the Dec. 31 legal deadline for reporting the new state population counts to the president.  Keeping to that timeline would help ensure that — regardless of whether Trump wins reelection — he can control the numbers for reapportioning House seats before they're handed off to Congress for certification next year.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross — who oversees the bureau and is legally required to deliver the state numbers to the president — said that he will \"release this Census data publicly, and in keeping with past practice, will do so simultaneously with its delivery to the President,\" as NPR reported on Wednesday.  A statement released by the bureau Friday, however, leaves open the possibility that those numbers won't be delivered to the president by the Dec. 31 deadline. The bureau now says it is \"working hard to process the data in order to deliver complete and accurate state population counts as close to the December 31, 2020, statutory deadline as possible.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 6, "positive": 34, "negative": 10, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 3, "anger": 14, "surprise": 5, "fear": 7, "trust": 3}, "metadata": ["supreme", "unauthorized", "census", "calling", "presidential", "unprecedented", "arguments", "counts", "trump", "term", "state's", "immigration", "repeatedly", "american", "liberties", "citizenship", "congress", "illegal", "president's", "person's", "customs", "detention", "john", "lawsuit", "court's", "reporting", "ensure", "certification", "legally", "npr"]}, {"text": "Because the U.S. Supreme Court essentially laughed President Trump’s arguments for a citizenship question out of its courtroom last summer, the start of America’s once-a-decade official head count at the beginning of next month will be far from an April Fool’s joke.  Once the Census Bureau begins mailing out questionnaires, sending operatives to knock on doors and puts its forms on the Internet, much of California’s fate will be in the hands of its people, residents of every size, shape, color, belief and ethnicity.  If we want our schools fully funded, if we want our roads and infrastructure properly maintained and rebuilt, if we want the significant voice we deserve in both public policy and the Electoral College, it will be up to us to make sure we get counted.  For a while, it appeared that Trump’s administration might insert a citizenship question among the standard queries to be answered by almost everyone who gets counted. But Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, a Republican appointee of ex-President George W. Bush, became disgusted last July with lies told by Trump’s Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, as he tried to explain why a citizenship question should be used for the first time in 70 years.  Ross said the question was needed to fully enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965, an absurd claim since that law has never been enforced under Trump. Roberts wrote that this falsehood demanded he cast a rare vote with the high court’s four-member liberal minority and that deep-sixed the question.  This was a vital issue for California and other states with large numbers of undocumented persons because long experience and every Census expert indicated that including the question would encourage many unauthorized residents to evade getting counted at all costs.  Now they have no reason to avoid answering questions, since it will be impossible to identify non-citizens if immigration authorities somehow get hold of Census forms despite laws forbidding it.  Such compartmentalizing is needed to assure that the constitutional purpose of the Census is carried out: counting every human being in the country, citizen or not.  Representation in Congress and the Electoral College hinges on that count. So does distribution of myriad types of federal grants and other funding.  This still does not assure it will be easy to count everyone. For example, there is California’s homeless populace of at least 150,000 persons, counted in an unofficial canvass every January. There are also under-the-radar undocumented immigrants who often share motel rooms and other transient quarters.  Altogether, the Seattle-based Marguerite Casey Foundation estimates California has more than 15 million people classed as hard to count. To see that its interests are properly served, the state in 2018 budgeted $187 million to get everyone here tallied.  Some of that money went to private organizations now reaching out to folks they serve.  “Our goal is to reach 2.7 million people (in the Los Angeles area),” said Esperanza Guevara, coordinator of the Census campaign about to start from the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, which also tries to get health care and other services for the undocumented.  “We’ve developed a comprehensive campaign in our Latino, refugee and limited English communities to (give them) the support and resources to understand these forms,” she added.  And Thomas Saenz, president of the activist Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, told his group’s affiliates that “Information about immigration status will not be asked of anyone… In fact, the easiest way to avoid further contact from the Census Bureau is to fill out the form completely at the start of the process.”  One message many such outfits will be circulating widely: It is illegal to use information on Census forms in immigration enforcement. Violating this confidentiality carries criminal penalties up to $250,000 and five years in jail per incident.  It’s still unknown whether all this will be enough to ensure the full count California needs in order to get its fair share of money and representation.  But for sure, the Trump administration’s initial efforts to skew the count have been thwarted, leaving much of this state’s fate in the hands of its residents.

Prev Next View All  In the early days of the pandemic, the phrase “Grandma killers” provided a convenient shorthand for the evil Republican stooges advocating for keeping businesses open, hosting public gatherings, and generally going mask-off (heh) about their desire to forsake public health for the sake of a robust stock market. Inherent to the phrase was an implied straw-man setup: Anyone rich enough to be deeply concerned about the stock market would have the resources to keep beloved elderly relatives protected, while a separate set of less affluent grandchildren suffer the consequences of these policies.   Advertisement  But perhaps this was foolish thinking. Consider the case of Stephen Miller, cartoon villain and lead Republican stooge whose Grandma appears to have been quite simply killed by his boss. Ruth Glosser, Miller’s maternal grandmother, died earlier this month from lingering effects of covid-19, Mother Jones reports. David Glosser, Miller’s uncle, wrote that he blames his nephew and the larger Trump administration for triggering his mother’s death, writing on Facebook: I’m angry and outraged at [Miller] directly and the administration he has devoted his energy to supporting.”  In a completely normal and ordinary response to Glosser’s grief, the White House shot back by calling him a big fat liar.   Advertisement  In a statement sent to Mother Jones, a White House press affiliate responded: “His grandmother did not pass away from COVID. She was diagnosed with COVID in March and passed away in July so that timeline does not add up at all. His grandmother died peacefully in her sleep from old age.”  Mother Jones points out that Glosser formerly worked in public health and his mother’s death certificate, which they’ve posted to the article, lists her cause of death as “‘respiratory arrest’ resulting from ‘COVID-19.’” But also, just what the fuck?  Rose Glosser, according to her son, taught social work in Pennsylvania, founded a program for foster parents of children with special needs, and spent her life fighting for equal education, and “civil rights.” Miller’s uncle, meanwhile, has consistently used his relationship with his good-for-nothing nephew to undermine his hateful policies. Glosser wrote a piece for Politico calling his nephew an “immigration hypocrite” and took the occasion of Miller’s wedding to offer up a donation to the Jewish refugee resettlement agency HAIS. (The two have not spoken for a while.)  So it’s only fitting that he would use the tragic occasion of his mother’s death to point out the crucial role of immigrants in providing care in her final years:  I neglected to mention that in mom’s declining years she was lovingly cared for by health aides nurses, and doctors from India, Philippines, Mexico, Nicaragua, Haiti, Korea, El Salvador, Uganda, and Nigeria. Immigrants all of them. I am indebted to them for helping us through some very difficult times. Without them there would be no one to take care of our elderly.

(He has been nicknamed ‘Tear-Gas Ted’ for the ample use of the crowd control substance by the city’s police, for which the mayor is also the commissioner.)   Advertisement  But perhaps Ted will have a little more perspective now that he has been tear-gassed along with his populace. It happened last night, as Ted made a rare appearance at the protests in downtown Portland, allegedly to calm crowds that were facing off against federal troops.  But while Ted was, I imagine, arguing about the need to avoid violence and stand back peacefully while being pummelled with rounds of rubber bullets, the federal agents sent a round of tear-gas into the protesters, hitting Ted. He “appeared slightly dazed and coughed,” wrote the AP.   Advertisement   From the Associated Press:  He put on a pair of goggles someone handed him and drank water but did not leave his spot at the front of the protest and continued to take tear gas as the demonstration raged — with protesters lighting a large fire between protective fencing and the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse amid the pop-pop-pop sounds of the federal agents deploying tear gas and stun grenades into the crowd.

There have been other police custody deaths, but this one has touched a nerve. “I was really surprised to see how many young, white people were on the streets,” says Kikélola Roach, the Unifor Chair in Social Justice and Democracy at Ryerson University, whose father, Charles Roach, led civil rights marches against police violence in Toronto in the 70s.  Asian-Canadians, Filipinx and Tamil-Canadians were at Saturday’s march, too. This could prove to be a watershed moment for the city – the country. The issue of anti-Black racism has reached the Cabinet table.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau used his COVID-19 briefing on June 1 to tell young Black Canadians “I hear you when you say you are anxious and angry.” Public safety minister Bill Blair, Toronto’s former chief of police, also weighed in to say that “now is the time to unite and to act” on anti-Black racism.  Riots across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, yet another unarmed Black man killed at the hands of police, has focused attention on our own history of police violence. As Ahmed Hussen, Canada’s former minister of immigration and refugees noted in an emotional thread on Twitter, “anti-Black racism does not stop at the border.”  The pandemic is causing us to re-evaluate all of our systems. And the tragic circumstances surrounding Korchinski-Paquet’s death is forcing us to consider what allyship with Black communities really means.  We need a new model when it comes to policing – indeed, in society in general – policing reform advocates say.  What that might look like runs the gamut from the “abolition” of policing – an idea that sounds more radical than it really is – to unarmed civilians and other personnel taking up community-based functions on the street. It also includes everything from the deployment of officers to the communities they live in, to special units to deal with violent situations only when they occur.  The truth for Black communities is that the current system isn’t working. Trust has been lost. Optimism can’t be relied on anymore.   Nick Lachance  HEADED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION  Questions remain about how 29-year-old Korchinski-Paquet, who was reportedly experiencing a mental health crisis, could end up falling to her death from the 24th floor of a High Park Avenue apartment with six police officers in the room. There are conflicting reports about that.  But for representatives of the city’s Black community and beyond, Korchinski-Paquet’s death is just another tragic example among many in recent years – indeed, dating back decades – of why the systems put in place to better police minority communities aren’t working.  We’ve spent millions training police on de-escalation techniques, anti-Black racism and on the use of less-lethal weapons in a bid to stem the bloodshed. Endless coroners’ inquests have made recommendations on how to address the problems. Now we’re outfitting police with body-worn cameras in the hope that it may check police/Black community interactions. At the same time, police are relying more on surveillance cameras to do their work in priority neighbourhoods.  Black people, meanwhile, continue to die and anti-Black racism persists. Black Torontonians are 20 times more likely than non-Black people to die in an encounter with police, according to one estimate.  “It’s dumbfounding,” says Urban Alliance on Race Relations president Nigel Barriffe. “We continue to go in the wrong direction.”  And police budgets keep sucking up more and more tax dollars – more than $1.076 billion this year in Toronto alone – as other city departments and social services buckle under the weight of cuts.  There have been calls to claw back police budgets for more than a decade as crime rates in most major categories have gone down. (Break and enter, theft, assault and sexual assault numbers were down by 8, 9, 13 and 20 per cent, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018).  There has also been a lot of talk about “transformation” and the need for police to engage communities and do things differently.  To that end, Mayor John Tory spokesperson Lawvin Hadisi points to the Neighbourhood Community Officer Program “to build positive relationships with people and communities,” the hiring in the last budget go-around of 40 “neighbourhood officers.” And the Youth In Policing Initiative “to connect with youth across the city and to teach them the important role that the police force plays in keeping Toronto safe.”  But police will tell you themselves that they are not social workers. So what’s the solution?   Nick Lachance   AN ABOLITIONIST PERSPECTIVE  Black academics like Angela Davis and Ruth Wilson Gilmore in the U.S. have been calling for the defunding of police and “abolition” of the “prison industrial complex” for years. The idea is gaining popularity in Canada where three per cent of the population is Black, but where Black people make up 9 per cent of the federal prison system.  “Abolition” doesn’t mean getting rid of police overnight, says Roach, but rather doing away with the conditions like lack of housing and food scarcity, which end up feeding the poverty-to-prison pipeline.  Racial justice lawyer Anthony Morgan, who joined the city’s Confronting Anti-Black Racism unit in 2018, argues that guns and gang violence are too often used to justify the high police presence in priority neighbourhoods, when the problem is really rooted in social disadvantage. He says that it should be left up to communities to determine what law enforcement looks like in their own neighbourhoods.  “At the end of the day, it’s their service. It’s funded through their tax dollars. The service should then be theirs to serve them.”  Versions of Morgan’s community-driven idea have been floated in the past in Toronto. Elements of it are already there in the city’s anti-Black racism action plan.  But the systems of police oversight in place to hold police accountable, which is widely viewed as being secretive and pro-police, must also be overhauled, reformers say. The only question is whether there is the political will to do it. The reality is the Black community has been living with a pandemic of police violence for a long time, says Roach.  “It’s a ripe time for larger conversations. People are expecting fundamental change. We’re seeing across the board how so many of our systems are not protecting life.”  She adds that, “Different activists have been arguing for years we should be reducing the prison population. Thousands have been released safely back into the population because of the pandemic. It raises the question: why were they there in the first place?”  The whole system of public safety – and the role of police in it – has to be re-imagined, because we’re all bearing the costs, be they social or economic, argues Black Lives Matter–Toronto co-founder Rodney Diverlus.  “If the COVID crisis has taught us anything, it’s the importance of transparency and actions. The financial impact will be devastating. Our budgets will be gutted. We as a city, as a province and as a country have to set new priorities. This is the new normal. We can continue to say the same things over and over again or we can use this moment for transformational change. We can’t afford to wait.”   Nick Lachance  A SYSTEM SET UP TO FAIL  The previous Liberal government of Kathleen Wynne had jarred the door open to a new paradigm in policing, turning over to cities the authority to develop community safety plans instead of leaving that power with police services boards. The Wynne government also introduced a historic overhaul of the system of police oversight, which had long been seen as secretive and pro-police.  But those reforms were trashed by Doug Ford’s government on the eve they were scheduled to go into effect. “Police have our back. And now their government has theirs,” is how Sylvia Jones, the Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services, put the reason for the decision.  “Black communities came out to rage and cry and ask for change, and then one election and all that was wiped away,” says Diverlus.  The move undid the adoption of dozens of recommendations made by Justice Michael Tulloch in his expansive 2017 report on police oversight and, in particular, the workings of the province’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the provincial watchdog charged with conducting probes into serious incidents involving police.  Which is why so few policing observers have faith we will ever know what really led to Korchinski-Paquet falling to her death.  The problems affecting policing and its accountability mechanisms are not about a few bad apples, as Tulloch noted in his report. They’re systemic. In a way, the system is practically set up to fail.   NIck Lachance   “OUTRAGEOUS LIES”  In the Korchinski-Paquet death, police are already rewriting the narrative.  Details leaked to the Toronto Sun and published on Wednesday (June 4) alleging that Korchinski-Paquet barricaded herself on her balcony before falling to her death could only have come from police, says the family’s lawyer Knia Singh.  “I’m disappointed. The only way that story could have been written is that the witness officers or subject officers – or someone they shared the story with – shared it with the Sun. It’s highly irresponsible.”  Singh says the turn has tainted the SIU’s investigation.  “The public wants answers – we need transparency. The SIU is supposed to be conducting an independent investigation, but the way this is unfolding is making me believe that it’s not.”  Despite being bound by law not to comment during an ongoing SIU probe, police chief Mark Saunders also weighed in on the death, calling a press conference on Friday afternoon to call allegations on social media about the police’s alleged involvement in Korchinski-Paquet’s fall “outrageous lies.”  No one save for the officers in the apartment at the time knows for sure. But the chief went further to shape the narrative, saying that police were responding to an “assault” and that knives were involved.  The remarks had the effect of deflecting attention from police actions, says former police services board chair Alok Mukherjee. In particular, why a nurse from the force’s mobile crisis response team wasn’t dispatched, as per protocol for people experiencing mental distress. As importantly, Saunders’ remarks also serve to colour the SIU’s investigation.  “No one else said there was a conflict,” says Mukherjee. “It’s Saunders who puts the knife in her [Korchinski-Paquet’s] hand.”  A statement released by the family on the circumstances surrounding the death says “there was no knife present and no assault taking place” when police arrived.  According to the family’s version of events, “multiple police officers” followed Korchinski-Paquet into the apartment – she said she had to use the bathroom – following a conversation in the hallway that included her mother and brother. A “commotion” was heard a minute or two later followed by Korchinski-Paquet crying out, “Mom help, mom help, mom help.” Then there was silence.  The family says that, “Eventually an officer came out of the unit, knocked on the neighbour’s door, and stated to the family that she is over at the neighbour’s house or in the unit below. After a few moments the mother then asked the officers if she is on the ground. An officer went into the unit, then came back out and told her mother, ‘Yes, she is on the ground.’” The family says the death could have been prevented.  Saunders has noted that a Section 11 review will be conducted after the SIU’s probe is completed to determine whether procedures and policies were followed. Mukherjee is not holding out faith in that review given the chief has already stated publicly that he believes police were walking into a dangerous situation.  Mukherjee suggests a coroner’s inquest may be the only way to get the full picture of what happened. But that would take years. Some are not willing to wait that long.  The demand for answers has turned up the heat on the SIU, which is now being asked by police and the family of Korchinski-Paquet to dispense with business as usual and release information on its probe as it becomes available – presumably, so that we can all be assured things are on the up and up.  It’s a big shift for an organization that – save for a handful of former directors willing to push the envelope – has made confidentiality its modus operandi. And after spending the better part of 2018 preparing for the changes that were supposed to be coming after Tulloch’s report, is back to square one. The SIU has also just undergone a change in leadership with former deputy director Joseph Martino taking over in March.   Nick Lachance   SECRECY VERSUS ACCOUNTABILITY  The SIU has issued a number of statements on Korchinski-Paquet’s death. None of them mentions a knife.  The SIU confirms in a statement that the subject officer and five witness officers in the case have been interviewed. (Four civilian witnesses have also come forward).  But as per current protocol, the SIU is not releasing any information on whether the police turned over their notes of the incident. Witness officers are required to turn over their notes.  The current systems of accountability being what they are, it’s difficult to have confidence the SIU will be able to answer all the questions arising from this case, policing reformers say.  Part of that has to do with the fact the SIU’s mandate is narrowly focused to find criminal wrongdoing, which is a high threshold to meet when it comes to cops. The SIU has rarely found fault with police actions. Historically, more than 90 per cent of the cases it investigates end in officers being cleared. The SIU is also handcuffed by legislation setting out its responsibilities.  The Police Services Act says police must “fully cooperate” with the SIU. But that’s not so simple in practice. There’s little the SIU can do to compel a subject officer to cooperate if the officer refuses. A police chief may lay a discipline charge, but that rarely happens. The Officer of the Independent Police Review Director, which reviews public complaints against police, can sanction a police officer for obstructing an investigation. So too can the provincial ombudsman, but not the SIU.  A subject officer is also not required to turn over their notes. The justification for that has to do with the notion that an officer has the right, like anyone else, not to incriminate themself. That argument doesn’t hold up when you consider the immense power given police to use lethal force.  To be sure, whether the notes of an officer will be admissible in a future court preceding is up to a judge. The Harnick Directive, named after Mike Harris-era Attorney-General Charles Harnick, also orders that notes should not be used by prosecutors to impeach an officer’s testimony.  Tulloch recommended expanding the definition of an officer’s duty to cooperate.  Tammy Landau, associate professor of criminology at Ryerson University and an expert in police oversight, says the balance between protecting evidence and the public’s right to know what’s happening in investigations has historically been skewed in favour of the police.  “The SIU is seen as independent, but the time they have historically taken to get their act together has undermined any confidence that there isn’t either collusion or lack of priority on these cases. In this example, you’re talking about a person that was emotionally distressed and the history of Toronto police with people in emotional distress has been abysmal.”  Barriffe says there’s a double standard at play when it comes to police cooperation with the SIU. “They ask the community to speak up when someone is shot, but use every excuse in the book when it’s one of their own.”  Some city councillors are now calling for an independent investigation of Korchinski-Paquet’s death to be conducted outside the SIU. City council, in fact, supported a motion by Mike Layton and Kristyn Wong-Tam last year calling on the province’s Anti-Racism Directorate to review the handling of SIU cases involving racialized people. But that request got lost in the Ford government’s move to reduce the size of the directorate.   Nick Lachance  REIMAGINING THE ROLE OF POLICE  Diverlus wonders what could have been had Korchinski-Paquet’s had there been other community-driven alternatives been in place – the kind envisioned by policing reformers – and she had been able to call someone other than police.  He says that we can’t continue to see police “as the de facto be all and end all” when it comes to public safety. That reimagining of the role of police goes for members of Black communities as well, says Diverlus, who he notes expressed anxiety and balked as well when BLM-TO demanded the removal of police from Pride and Toronto schools.  He says that Black communities “would also rather not have to continue talking about anti-Black racism. Hopefully what’s happened is a wake-up call.”  Barriffe is more circumspect about future reform. “When I look at my four-year-old and see the gasoline being poured on fires [by Donald Trump in the U.S.], I wonder whether he’s going to be fighting the same fight 20 years from now… it’s hard.”  He says we’ve been talking about community-based policing and diversity in the police for too long. “It’s just window dressing at this point.”  He says the city can start changing the current dynamic by putting money that’s going to policing into decent housing. And the police can start by holding someone accountable for Korchinski-Paquet’s death. “You can’t spin this.”   Nick Lachance   @nowtoronto  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 45, "positive": 87, "negative": 51, "disgust": 4, "joy": 9, "anger": 42, "surprise": 4, "fear": 67, "trust": 17}, "metadata": ["custody", "violence", "racism", "minister", "trudeau", "unarmed", "focused", "immigration", "pandemic", "surrounding", "advocates", "radical", "violent", "weapons", "priority", "tax", "crime", "engage", "mayor", "john", "spokesperson", "youth", "calling", "canada", "confronting", "argues", "oversight", "protecting", "covid", "crisis", "overhaul", "reforms", "correctional", "election", "dozens", "michael", "conducting", "independent", "ongoing", "media", "nurse", "deputy", "criminal", "admissible", "prosecutors", "professor", "university", "undermined", "cooperation", "donald", "trump", "diversity", "accountable"]}, {"text": "In the midst of yet another fraught campaign cycle, it’s important to stop and appreciate the little things.

To be clear, I’m not celebrating Klobuchar’s exit itself; I’ve always had an inexplicable soft spot for the comb-toting, wisecracking Minnesota senator.  What’s truly amazing about Klobuchar’s departure from the 2020 race is its timing. Her departure comes not even 24 hours after Pete Buttigieg—with whom Klobuchar notably sparred at the most recent debate—announced his own campaign suspension on Sunday night.  Things had heated up between Klobuchar and Buttigieg at the preceding debate, with Buttigieg calling out Klobuchar’s inability to recall the name of the president of Mexico, and Klobuchar pulling him up on it: “Are you trying to say that I’m dumb—are you mocking me here, Pete?” she asked. They followed up with even more retorts; Buttigieg questioned Klobuchar’s immigration voting record, to which she responded, “I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete, but let me tell you what it’s like to be in the arena.”  The internet exploded after Klobuchar and Buttigieg’s verbal quarrel, which was reminiscent of nothing more so than an exasperated mom fighting with her honor-roll-topping teenage son after he sneeringly corrected her pronunciation of “Baja Blast” in the middle of a crowded Taco Bell.  Now, Twitter is abuzz over Klobuchar’s recent exit, which some see as suspiciously timed to outlast Buttigieg by a single day. Klobuchar did fire off a message of support to Buttigieg after his exit, but you know what they say about actions speaking louder than words.

Monica has chosen to remain partially anonymous because of her immigration status. Cheyce Batchelor/Fresh Take Fllorida  She didn’t know how much the bus ticket was, but she knew it was her only option.  The 26-year-old woman hoped the journey from Guatemala to the United States would finally get her and her firstborn son away from his abusive father. Her brother, who had lived in Florida for four years, paid for the ticket.  About two years after applying for asylum, Monica now lives in central Florida with her 11- and 1-year-old sons. Without a legal work permit, she makes about $400 a week on a construction site cleaning walls and windows.  Monica, who asked to not have her last name published because of concerns of prosecution for working without a permit, has worked for months unaware of a bill that may sweep her income from underneath her feet.  In 2018, then-republican-gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis ran on the promise of mandating the statewide use of E-Verify, an online government program that checks if an individual is authorized to work.  SB664, dubbed the “E-Verify bill,” was approved by the Florida state legislature after a series of last-minute compromises. The bill requires employers to check and keep track of potential employees’ legal status to prevent undocumented workers like Monica from getting jobs.  Although the bill made it to the finish line, the session came to an unusual end as the COVID-19 outbreak worsened in Florida.  DeSantis previously told reporters that he would focus on the pandemic and hold off on reviewing the almost 200 billsawaiting his signature. He began signing a handful of bills into law April 8.  The E-Verify bill is divisive, not just among Democrats and Republicans, but within the GOP itself.  Many Republican lawmakers were caught between choosing business interests or the conservative voter base during an election year. Business groups — especially the agricultural, construction and hospitality industries that rely on migrant labor — have financially supported Republican campaigns while advocating against E-Verify.  Meanwhile, immigrant rights groups have opposed E-Verify legislation at every turn.  Jeannie Economos, a Farmworker Association of Florida coordinator, said lawmakers play “political football” with workers’ lives by slipping anti-immigrant rhetoric into legislation.  “Campaign promises and rhetoric might help somebody get elected, but it also hurts a lot of people,” she said.  An E-Verify bill has never made it this far in the Sunshine State, although Republican lawmakers have tried. In 2010, then-republican-gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott said he wanted all businesses to use the system. But, a 2011 bill that would have required E-Verify failed.  The legislature took up the issue again after DeSantis took office but squashed it, though the state did ban sanctuary cities.  In January, lawmakers were choosing among two versions of an E-Verify proposal. The first bill, filed by Sen. Tom Lee, a Brandon Republican, required both private and public employers to use E-Verify. The second — filed by Sen. Joe Gruters, a Sarasota Republican and the chairman of the Florida Republican Party — required only public employers to use the program. Senate President Bill Galvano was initially opposed to the E-Verify proposal.  “One’s a little bit more aggressive than the other, but at the end of the day, what we’re trying to do is we’re trying to protect the Florida worker,” Gruters said on the first day of the session. “Washington, D.C., has failed us on illegal immigration.”  Lee’s bill eventually moved through committees while amendments piled up. In February, Lee told reporters he would prod DeSantis to veto the bill if it ever landed on his desk.  The final version of the bill was stripped of an enforcement provision that would allow the state to randomly audit businesses that choose to not use E-Verify, which House Speaker Jose Oliva called un-American.  If DeSantis signs the bill, as he is expected to do, all public employers, contractors and subcontractors must register with the E-Verify system to hire new employees beginning Jan. 1. Private employers have the option of using E-Verify or the documents required for an I-9 form, but they must keep copies of those documents at least three years.  Certain government agencies can request copies of documents from the private employer to verify an employee’s eligibility to work. The bill also penalizes businesses that don’t use E-Verify by essentially making them ineligible to apply for economic development incentives.  Civil liberty groups often blast E-Verify as a “faulty” system.  Kara Gross, the ACLU of Florida legislative director and senior policy counsel, said legal workers have been incorrectly flagged for errors like typos or name changes after marriage. Flagged workers must prove the mistake within eight days.  According to a study by the Cato Institute, a libertarian, pro-immigration think-tank, about 750,000 legal workers have been incorrectly flagged by E-Verify since 2007. E-Verify’s government website says more than 98% of cases in the 2019 fiscal year were approved as eligible to work. Of the 1.50% of employees who “received initial system mismatches,” 0.23% resolved the issue, according to the website.  Gross criticized DeSantis’ persistence despite pushback from Republican, business and faith leaders who say E-Verify would wreck the economy.  “Given that our economy is so fragile right now with everything going on with COVID-19, signing this bill into law will further harm Florida’s economy,” she said.  The bill also sparked mixed reactions from anti-immigration organizations, like the Federation for American Immigration Reform. Shari Rendall, the FAIR director of state and local engagement, said the bill’s approval was “a good first step.”  But, for the Center for Immigration Studies, another generally anti-immigration group, the weakened bill is inadequate.  Jessica Vaughan, the center’s director of policy studies, said DeSantis should send the bill back to the drawing board for a stricter mandate, especially after thousands of Floridians lost their jobs to the pandemic.  “Now is an ideal time to make sure that once these jobs come back, they come back for legal workers,” she said.  As the bill was watered down in Tallahassee, local advocacy groups struggled to keep rural immigrant communities informed about legislation. About 250 miles south in Apopka, Juana Lozano and Yesica Ramirez work in the Farmworker Association’s dimly lit office space.  They said the majority of the immigrants and migrants they serve don’t know about the bill or what E-Verify is. Nonprofit workers try to educate community members at events by referring to the system as “checking your papers,” Lozano said.  If passed, Lozano said, the law may affect about 80% of Apopka’s immigrant community to some degree.  “We are part of this community more than you can imagine,” Ramirez said.  While sitting in the same office, Monica’s 1-year-old son squirms out of her lap and onto the floor. He crawls past his older brother who fiddles with a Rubik’s Cube.  She said she’s frustrated by lawmakers who “think we’re all the same.”  “It worries me because there are a lot of undocumented people like me, and not having a job would affect us a lot,” she said. “We wouldn’t be able to support our families, our sons, we couldn’t pay our bills.”  Monica learned about E-Verify when she was asked to do an interview with Fresh Take Florida, a news service operated by the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications. None of the other workers at her construction job know about the bill, although she said the majority of them would be affected.  She wishes she knew sooner.

(Photo: NDTV)  Chandigarh: In a pink-walled room of a government office at the foot of the Himalayas, women spend their days cancelling the passports of runaway husbands.  Midday on a Monday, the father of a woman who married a merchant marine is explaining how the husband lied about being single and failed to disclose the fact that he had a child and a warrant for his arrest.  The case, says worker Amritpal Kaur, should qualify for immediate impoundment of the man's passport. Kaur isn't a government employee at all.  She and the other women who work in the passport office are abandoned wives, volunteering their hours at the office to help women like them.  Sibash Kabiraj, regional passport chief in Chandigarh, says it all began when the wives started coming to him and pleading for help.  A lifelong bureaucrat with a taste for the fine print, Kabiraj realised the law would allow him to suspend - and even cancel - the passports of overseas Indian men who had misled their wives.  The Passport Authority requires approval from the central government to take away a passport but can do so if the holder lies or withholds information, or if there is a warrant or court summons, among other reasons.  But there was a problem.  \"One suspension of a passport, it requires a lot of paperwork,\" he says.  Not one to be stopped, he explained passport law to the women, gave them a room with a computer, printer and fax machine, and told them if they would do the paperwork, he would sign it.  It's the women's best way of seeking justice from their far-away husbands, he says.  In the past year and a half, the women have managed to suspend more than 400 passports and revoke 67 others, Kabiraj says. In all, more than 5,000 women have filed abandonment complaints with the Ministry of External Affairs.  In all, more than 5,000 women have filed abandonment complaints with the Ministry of External Affairs.  Indians living abroad aren't an easy group to take issue with. They sent $79 billion in remittances to India in 2018, the most of any country in the world, according to World Bank data. They're expected to send $82.2 billion in 2019.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called non-resident Indians, or NRIs, the \"brand ambassadors of India\". But the government's policy think tank NITI Aayog nicknamed them \"non-reliable Indian grooms\".  The wives say many of the men demand - and often get - tens of thousands of dollars in dowry, despite the practice being illegal.  The husbands can use that money to establish themselves overseas and obtain permanent residency or a new passport, leaving their wives and children behind - and in limbo.  An abandoned woman has no status, says Shiwali Suman, who organises abandoned wives in New Delhi. \"Are we divorced, single, widowed?\" she asks. \"What are we actually? We are not able to be categorized.\"  The men deny they have done anything wrong, saying they did their best but were taken advantage of by their wives.  One says his life is 'hell' now and he no longer trusts women.  The wives left behind don't see it that way. In recent months, city and rural women alike have begun staging protests. One woman at a recent protest in Jalandhar in Punjab said time was up for the runaway men: \"There's a fire erupting in all of us.\"  Reena Mehla was 24 when she got married. Five years later, she says, her husband told her he was going to work extra police duty shifts elsewhere in India, and instead hired smugglers to take him to the United States.  Rahul Kumar now lives in the Bronx. Mehla wrote to the Ministry of External Affairs, the US Embassy, US Citizenship and Immigration Services and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, searched Facebook, and eventually found him.  She scrolls through dozens of emails she sent to foreign officials and the letter showing his passport was revoked; according to the US Justice Department immigration court hotline, his status in that country is pending.  Then she pulls up one of their wedding pictures and kisses it.  When asked if she still loves him, Mehla stretches her arms and grins. 'Too much!'  She had the inner strength to leave her rural home and move on her own to Chandigarh to volunteer in the passport office.  \"Even our soul is not allowed because a husband is everything. A husband is like God,\" she says.  She shares her flat with several women, including Amritpal Kaur.  Because most of the women in this story go by the name Kaur, Reuters is using their first names on second reference to ease confusion.  When Amritpal talks about her marriage, she keeps coming back to the money she spent on it: She says she forked over $28,000 on the dowry and wedding; three days after they were married, she says, her husband told her to get $14,000 more from her father.  Her husband, Kulpreet Singh, said all the money she had earned working for two years in England also needed to come to him, she says.  Two weeks after the wedding, he left for Australia. For months afterward, he told her he had a surprise. She was so excited she ordered a $3,500 diamond ring for him.  His surprise, she says, was divorce papers. Rahul and Kulpreet did not respond to requests for comment.  Amritpal now shares a rented flat in Chandigarh with Reena and several other women. As a reminder of their mission, they've named the computer folder that holds their files 'Mission Shakti'.  \"Shakti is women's spiritual power to fight against this,\" Amritpal says. \"We don't want any other girls to be victims like us.\"  Every day, women with husband problems pile into Satwinder Kaur's family courtyard in a village surrounded by mustard fields that blaze like the sun.  Only a few thousand people live in Toosa, but her relationships span the globe.  She's helping nearly 400 women who've been abandoned by their men, she says, getting several of their runaway husbands deported from their adopted countries and jailed. Every few minutes her phone rings.  Satwinder's own husband left her in 2015. He now lives in Poland. In Toosa, women don't venture out at night and are rarely left home alone, even in walled family compounds.  Satwinder is slowly breaking through this - and in the process has become a symbol of a newfound willingness to fight back against a patriarchal system.  She runs a WhatsApp group and Facebook page, and tells rural women what paperwork they need to cancel their husbands' passports. She also organizes protests.  Satwinder Kaur's has filed 11 court cases against her NRI husband who abandoned her.  \"It's hard to be a middle-aged, childless woman whose husband has left her,\" she said.  She holds up photographs of fantastically lavish weddings produced from plastic bags or passed around on mobile phones and shared on WhatsApp.  From Facebook, there are other pictures: of the husbands' foreign girlfriends and children and anniversary cakes.  Even for Satwinder, who has filed 11 court cases against her husband, it's hard to be a middle-aged, childless woman whose husband has left her. Her ferocity is in constant battle with her fear.  She sends her husband WhatsApp messages every day.  She can tell he's read every one of them because of the little blue checkmarks, but he hasn't replied since January.  Neighbours and even relatives call her banj, or 'rotten womb', she says. \"In my own house, I was called that.\"  A lecturer and electrical engineer, her husband, Arvinder Pal Singh, sees it differently. He says he moved to Europe because of pressure to earn more.  He says he tried and failed to bring Satwinder to Europe on a student visa and says he was blindsided by problems between his wife and his mother when he returned home for a visit.  He lost his job and moved twice. He told Satwinder he would send money again when he had it.  Two months later she filed a case with the police and his father was arrested, he says. He later got a call from the Indian Embassy saying his passport had been cancelled.  He stopped sending money and filed for divorce, which didn't go through.  Arvinder says he no longer trusts women and calls himself a refugee.  \"I don't have family. At least she is with family. She is in her home country. I don't have a country. I don't have a place to stay, and where I'm standing it's already raining outside,\" he says. \"This is hell.\"  He says he would be arrested if he returned to India and doesn't believe he would get a fair hearing in court. Now undocumented, he uses smugglers to move.  Baljit Kaur lives two lives. In the first, she's a policewoman, composed and authoritative in a pressed uniform and red lipstick.  In the second, she's an aging bride, abandoned by her husband and sleeping under sheets printed with red hearts.  \"I never imagined a woman of my age would end up like this,\" she says. \"I thought my life would be different.\"  Baljit, 42, was one of four siblings born to an army officer and his wife in Punjab. She waited for her siblings to settle, so, at age 39, was late to marry.  When pushed, she paid a large dowry, even though as a cop, she knew such payments were illegal.  Before the wedding, Baljit says, her fiance, Harmandeep Singh Sekhon, would call to ask how much cash she would give his family.  After the wedding, she says, her in-laws complained she hadn't brought as much as her sister-in-law.  Soon Baljit understood why she'd been chosen: \"I understood he didn't want me, he only wanted money.\"  Baljit Kaur who's a policewoman and an aging bride says, \"I thought my life would be different.\"  One month and two days after they married, her husband returned to the United States. He'd lived there before, and they'd talked about moving there together.  A week after he arrived, she says, he called saying he had no job and needed her to send money. She refused.  She last spoke to her husband on October 6, 2014. They have been locked in a legal battle ever since.  She has been granted ownership of their house and has won maintenance costs, but those have yet to be paid, she says. She has spent more than $4,000 on lawyers' fees.  \"I have a job, I can manage. But what about the girls who can't?\" she says.  Harmandeep did not respond to requests for comment.  Baljit became a cop in 1995. She worked her way up through training courses and exams and is an assistant sub-inspector at Fatehgarh Sahib District headquarters in Punjab.  She has a sunny government flat with a plant-filled terrace and drives both a scooter and a car.  Her hard-won career makes it even more humiliating that she was abandoned so publicly - and yet so intimately. As a police officer, shouldn't she have seen it coming?  \"Sometimes she was brave,\" said Harpreet Kaur, a fellow officer who would pace the police station corridors with Baljit as she confided her troubles.  \"Sometimes she would say...that people would laugh at her because she was a police officer and this thing happened.\"  Baljit is spare with the details but admits she contemplated suicide: once before marriage when her husband was demanding money, other times after he left her.  Baljit still says she doesn't feel like living. Her mother, whose imagined grief stopped her from committing suicide before, died in May. \"What else remains?\" she asks. \"I am alone.\"  Of abandoned brides like herself, Baljit says: \"We are like dead bodies walking. We have no place in society. We can't live and we can't even die.\"  Baljit's fellow officers have rallied around her. At lunchtime, half a dozen officers layout newspapers on a desk and unpack their tiffins for a shared meal. \"We are her family,\" Inspector Kuldeepak Sharma says. \"She is not alone here.\"  Sarbjeet Kaur's husband stopped sending money for his daughter's school fees in 2016, with three months left in the term. Sarbjeet sold her sofa and two cupboards so she could finish.  Last year, she sold the gold earrings her parents had given to her daughter - again, for school fees, this time at her new, cheaper school.  \"I'm living a double life,\" Sarbjeet says, crying as she explains that she couldn't tell her parents she had sold the earrings, so she said she had lost them.  Sarbjeet married Daler Singh in 2008. It wasn't until she was pregnant that he talked of going abroad, she says. Her brother had gone to Italy, and it was eight years before he came back for a visit. She said no.  He told her: \"'There is nothing here. There are no jobs, no money. Whatever job you do, you don't make money.'' She eventually agreed. When her family got angry, she replied that Singh would never lie to her or leave her.  Singh went to South America first, then Mexico, Sarbjeet says. She sold her jewellery for almost $5,000 to help him cross into the United States in late 2010, she says, and borrowed $3,600 from her parents to help him enter Canada four years later.  She wanted her daughter, Ekampreet, to study in Canada, so she pawned her cousins', aunts' and friends' jewellery for $700, too.  He did send money back, but only for his family, she says. \"Don't worry,'' she says he told her, 'my one-month salary will buy your jewellery back and I'll pay back your parents, too.'  She shows pictures of him posing beside fancy cars on Facebook; she knows he was actually working as a gas station attendant.  In 2015, he asked for a divorce, saying he needed a paper marriage to a Canadian woman so he could stay while the government processed his refugee application.  When Sarbjeet confronted the new woman in a series of audio messages on Facebook Messenger, the other woman said she would also fight. 'You have a daughter,' she said. 'I have a son.'  Sarbjeet's husband, Daler Singh, called her description of events 'fake'. He says he was 17 - a minor - when he married her, and that they have now been separated for a decade.  He says he has given her money and property but didn't give any further details or respond to specific questions.  Sarbjeet lives in sugar cane country where the chimneys of brick factories occasionally pierce the fields to puff gray smoke.  Her parents keep cows. She wants better for her daughter, so offered the new woman a compromise: If Singh would call his daughter regularly and send $142 a month for her expenses, she would drop her case and stop trying to cancel his passport.  He did for a while, then he stopped, she says. Now Sarbjeet worries constantly about money.  Sarbjeet was a beautician before she got married.  These days she stitches salwar kameez and simple dresses on a pedal-operated machine beside her bed to earn money.  She charges $2 for a dress, which takes her two days to finish. If there's a rush, she can do it overnight. The stress has sometimes overwhelmed Sarbjeet.  When Ekampreet was 3, Sarbjeet tried to commit suicide by drinking rat poison. Five years later, she tried again by slitting her wrists. She went twice to a hospital in Amritsar for depression.  Now, she says, she is stronger. In March, Sarbjeet applied to have Singh's passport impounded. Satwinder, whom she met late last year, helped. Eventually, the passport office called to say it was done.  When asked about her father, Ekampreet says only that she wants to ask him what she did wrong and why he left her.  Shuffling through a stack of pictures, she comes across a wedding photo of her parents, her mother in a bright red and gold sari. She quickly buries it in the looked-at pile.

She soon got a call from a company she had never heard of.  The woman who phoned from the company, Heies, invited Newton to apply for a job as a “local hub inspector.” When she started work in May, Newton began receiving boxes with Apple Watches and laptops in them. Her job was to open the boxes, check the contents and then mail them off to foreign addresses.  But something was off. The boxes were suspiciously plain, even though they included brand-name products. The name on the labels was never Newton’s. When she asked questions, her new employer stopped responding. In June, she reported Heies to the Better Business Bureau.  It turned out that Newton had become what is known in security circles as a money mule, an accomplice who, either knowingly or unknowingly, helps international criminal rings move their ill-gotten gains. In Newton’s case, swindlers appeared to be buying products in the United States with stolen money and then mailing them — using unwitting intermediaries like her to disguise their involvement — to overseas locations where the goods could be resold for cash.  “They really caught me at the perfect time,” said Newton, 24, who was living with her parents in Birmingham, Ala. “I was just one of those desperate people looking for a job.”  Since the pandemic’s onset in March, the number of criminal schemes relying on money mules has spiked, just when many people have lost their jobs and are vulnerable to exploitation. The volume of schemes has been turbocharged partly by criminals going after enticing pots of money from the U.S. government — specifically, the benefit programs that were set up to help people and businesses hurt by the pandemic-induced economic downturn, authorities said.  In total, online human resources schemes where criminals pose as potential employers have soared 295 per cent from a year ago, while schemes used for money laundering have skyrocketed by 609 per cent, according to security firm ZeroFox.  Many people who perpetrate these frauds are based overseas, authorities said, so they need to move the money to their home country. Banks and authorities have made it harder to launder money through traditional financial channels in recent years. So these criminals are now increasingly on the hunt for a larger supply of potential money mules just as many newly unemployed people look for work.  “It is something that is escalating because of the current environment,” said Robert Villanueva, a former Secret Service agent who now works on cybercrime intelligence for the security firm Q6 Cyber. “It has become hard to avoid.”  Money mules are not new, and their numbers have risen alongside online fraud more broadly over the last two decades. Some people enter the business knowing it is illegal. Advertisements looking for money mules on the so-called darknet, an anonymous corner of the internet popular with criminals, often acknowledge the illegal aspect of the work.  “Hi. I need an excellent professional bank accounts loader for long term business,” read one ad from May, which was turned up by darknet research firm Flashpoint.  Yet seven people who became money mules during the pandemic told The New York Times that they had no inkling of what their so-called employer was up to when they began the work. Many had recently lost their jobs and needed to pay the bills. To avoid exposure to the coronavirus, they were also looking for jobs to do from home, just what many swindlers want from a money mule.  Alma Sardas, 21, had been furloughed from her job at a hotel in Fort Worth, Texas, this spring when she saw a listing on jobs site ZipRecruiter advertising a work-from-home position as a “virtual assistant” to a businessman in Hong Kong.  Sardas sat through a formal interview and spoke with a man who called himself Hermann Ziegler, who said he would be her boss. Once she was hired, she was sent a cheque for $4,590 (U.S.) to deposit into her bank account. She was told to use some of the money for her expenses and to send the rest from her account to her new employer’s vendors.  Sardas became skeptical about why the money would need to go through her bank account and called local police. They explained that she had almost been caught in a classic money-laundering scheme.  “You make yourself so sincere and these people just take advantage of it,” she said, adding that she had shredded the cheque and reported the incident to ZipRecruiter. ZipRecruiter said it removed the job posting immediately.  The schemes using money mules are varied. Some people who become mules are victims of online romance frauds who make bank and wire transfers for people they believe care about them. Others, like Sardas, are asked to use their own bank accounts to make financial transactions on behalf of their new employers. Newton became embroiled in what is known as a reshipping scheme, where the fraudsters buy goods with their stolen money and then use mules to get the products overseas, where they can be resold.  Some of these operations have become well-oiled machines. William Zackery, 64, a substitute teacher in Northern California, began working with a company called SFP Shippers in May. SFP Shippers appeared to have multiple departments, a website and a custom online dashboard that he had to log in to each day.  Zackery, who was out of work, was enlisted to receive packages with expensive purses and cameras. It was his job to print new labels and ship the goods on to other places across the country. Many mule operations use multiple shipping legs to cover their tracks, security experts said.  Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...  At first, he did not think anything was amiss. “I was getting calls two or three times a day from my so-called supervisors,” he said. But when the new employer stopped communicating, “I started doing some research that I should have done at the beginning.”  Zackery ultimately reported SFP Shippers to local and national authorities; the company’s website has been taken down.  Sometimes people’s identities are used without their knowledge. Over the past few months, Scattered Canary, a Nigerian criminal operation, submitted fraudulent claims for unemployment benefits in at least 14 states and then had the money delivered to accounts that they had set up, in the names of their victims, with Green Dot, a financial services company, according to security firm Agari.  Scattered Canary then sent the money overseas through Green Dot’s online system, all before the person whose name was used was alerted to the new account, the security firm said.  Alison Lubert, a spokesperson for Green Dot, said the company works “around the clock and invests heavily to identify, block and address fraudulent activity.”  Jamarle Worilds, chief of the illicit finance unit of Homeland Security Investigations, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said many people who act as money mules “don’t actually understand that they are operating in the space.” He said he had recently received text messages offering him the opportunity to work from home, which he easily spotted as an effort to recruit him as a money mule.  “I’m not sure about how they got my information, but that’s what it’s come to,” he said.  In Newton’s case, the woman from Heies who called identified herself as Carla Neely. She told Newton that the company needed “hub inspectors” to move packages for customers. Newton was pointed to a company website and went through an interview and a formal human resources process before being hired.  “Congratulations! We were impressed with your interview and would like to extend you a conditional offer for the position of Local Hub Inspector at Heies,” Neely wrote to Newton in her hiring letter.  Apart from Apple Watches and laptops, Newton said, she was also sent odd items, including a pack of sponges and a garbage disposal.  By the time Newton reported Heies to the Better Business Bureau, the numbers and emails that the company had used were dead. Its website had also been taken down. The perpetrators, who have faced other online complaints, have not been caught.  “I feel scared that I have blood on my hands because I’m in the middle of a scam and I’m also in the middle of a pandemic,” Newton said. “They pretty much just took advantage of my vulnerability.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 14, "positive": 31, "negative": 12, "disgust": 2, "joy": 6, "anger": 33, "surprise": 1, "fear": 5, "trust": 14}, "metadata": ["centre", "online", "criminal", "united", "vulnerable", "hurt", "economic", "employers", "escalating", "robert", "illegal", "term", "pandemic", "northern", "ultimately", "unemployment", "spokesperson", "homeland", "immigration", "customs", "messages", "emails"]}, {"text": "The collection of Democrats vying to win the party’s nomination to take on President Trump in 2020 was larger and more diverse than any group of White House hopefuls since the modern primary process began.

Adopting war metaphors to describe our present experience of the pandemic is dangerous because it obscures the structural differences between war zones and pandemic zones, and encourages U.S. citizens to see themselves as victims of war. What is unfolding in the U.S. with COVID-19 is not a state fighting a war against its enemies, but a state-corporate assemblage that is maximizing its profits and using the pandemic as an excellent market opportunity.  Using war metaphors has allowed an egoistic and incompetent president to self-fashion himself as a hero. Donald Trump calls himself “a wartime president” and defines his response to COVID-19 as a “war against the virus.” These claims would probably surprise many in countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq, where people have been subjected to drone surveillance, bombs and U.S. occupation for nearly two decades. Moreover, the U.S. recently announced it would slash $1 billion in aid to Afghanistan during a time when it is estimated up to 80 percent of the population there could contract COVID-19 and the country already does not have the means to handle the pandemic.  In light of the two-decade long “war on terror” and a longer history of imperial violence unleashed on countries around the world, using war metaphors for the COVID-19 crisis actually perpetuates the indifference many U.S. citizens feel toward the victims of its imperial wars. For example, the term “war on terror” identifies no clear enemy, and its imprecise nature has allowed U.S. forces to carry out extraordinary renditions and to torture and kill anyone it deems the enemy. Similarly, to think of the virus as an invisible enemy entering the U.S. from outside allows the state to carry out violence indiscriminately against perceived enemies and hide the inadequate measures the state has taken to protect the most vulnerable.  We’ve already seen in previous decades how the “war on drugs” criminalized racial minorities in the United States while distracting from U.S.-backed “low-intensity” conflicts in Central America. Today, survivors of those conflicts and their descendants are perishing in overcrowded prisons and Immigration and Customs Enforcement migrant jails. The language of war and invasion from outside veils the racist and classist response of the state to the present crisis, and ignores the realities of why a disproportionate number of African Americans are dying from COVID-19.  It is not a coincidence that the United States has 2.5 times more prison cells than it does hospital beds. More than 2 million prisoners, disproportionately African Americans and people of color, remain at high risk behind bars; immigrants remain locked up in migrant jails, which were horrific before the outbreak of COVID-19; those without homes remain on the streets, vulnerable to infection and police sweeps; and Asian immigrants and Asian Americans alike face increased attacks as the president of the United States keeps calling COVID-19 a “Chinese virus.”  To think of the virus as an invisible enemy entering the U.S. from outside allows the state to carry out violence indiscriminately against perceived enemies.  Instead, we should think of our collective vulnerability as emerging out of the destabilizations produced by 40 years of free market economic policies. Author and journalist Naomi Klein has called the present moment one of “coronavirus capitalism,” to highlight how states and corporations profit from disasters and conflicts when people are at their most vulnerable. Neoliberalism is the dangerous ideology of individual freedom that has driven policies of privatization, deregulation and financialization. Neoliberalism is dangerous because it subordinates human need to market metrics, privileges competition over cooperation and is incapable of delivering long-term solutions, operating as it does according to short-term gain.  For we feel panic not simply because of the virus’s potential to kill us, but also because of the neoliberal economic policies that have left us woefully under-prepared to meet this global pandemic. Even those officials at the “front lines” of fighting this virus, such as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, have for decades systematically supported underfunding health care. At a moment in history when millions of people are losing their jobs, large swathes of the U.S. population lack access to insurance that can pay for the hospitalizations and medications they will need to save their lives.  Many hospitals around the country have been unable to cope because our health care system does not maintain hospital capacities beyond what is profitable. Hence, the panic many of us feel is amplified because we know that we may not receive the care we need, even as those who are wealthy will. COVID-19 is not the equalizer our politicians have made it out to be; it will in fact exacerbate inequality and disproportionately impact health care workers, the poor, people of color and other vulnerable groups.  COVID-19 is not the equalizer our politicians have made it out to be; it will in fact exacerbate inequality and disproportionately impact the poor, people of color and other vulnerable groups.  The panic we feel as we face the reality of the inadequacy of our social safety net is exacerbated by the despair we also feel as we witness how COVID-19 is not forcing politicians and corporations to abandon policies that are killing us, but instead enabling them to do the exact opposite.  COVID-19 is indeed a shock to the present political and economic regime, but what neoliberal practitioners are doing is assembling a response intended to expand corporate and elite power and wealth. So, even as millions of people are in fear of their lives and are unemployed, the neoliberal state is helping corporations more than survive, made amply clear by the fact that a large part of the $2 trillion bailout is reserved for corporate well-being.  Using war language suggests that there will at some point be a victory, a defeat of an enemy. Rather, we might kindle our hope for the world by rethinking the entrepreneurial and individualist common sense produced out of neoliberalism, and instead pool resources, share information and creatively collaborate to survive this global health threat.  Here we are thinking of efforts made by so many collectives to produce face shields or masks (using personal or university 3D printers) to donate to health care workers or to invent open-source designs for ventilators that can be constructed with basic materials. These hope-driven strategies operate across national borders, are attuned to scientific data and need, and respond to the challenges of climate change rather than opportunistic calls to nationalism.  These are some of the voices and examples we should turn our attention to now, to spark our own creative and collaborative reservoirs, and to drown out the war calls.  Copyright © Truthout.

The initiative, which is a partnership among NAHCON, Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) and the Saudi Arabian immigration department, is to enable screening of Nigerian pilgrims by Saudi Arabian immigration in Nigeria before departing to Saudi Arabia.  A statement signed and made available to Tribune Online by the Head, NAHCON Public Affairs Unit, Hajiya Fatima Sanda Umar, members of the committee were drawn from the NIS, health sector, national security, aviation agencies and NAHCON.  Speaking while inaugurating the technical committee, NAHCON Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, Alhaji Zikrullah Kunle Hassan, described the assignment as a call to national service that would assist Nigeria in qualifying for implementation of the MRI in the country.  He informed the committee members that part of their responsibilities was to study the MRI qualification requirements and to ensure that Nigeria met the conditions before arrival of the Saudi Arabian inspection team that would assess NAHCON’s request and readiness for inclusion in the project.  The committee’s terms of reference, according to the statement, included: to advise NAHCON on the appropriate time to host the Saudi inspection team; to facilitate the positive outcome of discussions and inspection of facilities by the Saudi contingent; to advise NAHCON on a draft agreement to be signed between the two countries on the MRI matter; to scrutinize the initiative for the possibility of security breach and advise accordingly; to make adequate arrangement for eventual take-off; to monitor the project after take-off and advise NAHCON on modification/improvement of scope thereafter; submission of periodic reports with recommendations on any matter incidental to the agreement.  The Makkah Route Initiative (MRI) is a Saudi-based project that will ease the immigration process and other security screening checks in the Kingdom.  According to Usara, pilgrims from participating countries would not have to undergo another screening upon arrival in Saudi Arabia but would instead move straight into their waiting buses that would convey them to their hotels where their luggage would be awaiting them as well.  This, she stated, was because pilgrims’ luggage would be collected from them from their country’s point of screening.  Five countries have already enrolled into the scheme, which Nigeria wishes to start on an experimental stage. Following a formal request to participate in the initiative in 2018, NAHCON followed up with two different reminders for inclusion in the scheme.  Usara stated that expression of conditional approval finally came recently through a letter the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah sent to NAHCON indicating its willingness to inspect Nigeria’s facilities before taking a decision.  Meanwhile, she informed the members of the coordinating committee are Dr Fatima Muhammad Yusuf; Dodo Ahmad; Ibrahim Usman; Manu Mohammed; A.B Hausawa; Musa Bello and Nura Dankande.  Others are NAHCON staff namely Dr Danbaba Haruna; Uztaz Muhammad Lamim and Barrister Usman Mamza, the Commission’s Legal Adviser.

He’s claimed that his wall will not only deter undocumented migrants from crossing the border but it will also prevent terrorism and crime and now, it provides health security.  On several occasions, Trump has tried to link his wall with protection from the Coronavirus. However, the pandemic is raging out of control within the United States. In fact, it’s other countries that are putting up barriers for Americans as they try to protect themselves from America’s failure to halt the spread of the disease.  Trump claimed that his border wall has protected the U.S. from Coronavirus.  ~On 6/23 in San Luis, AZ, Trump visited a newly built border barrier & said: “It stopped COVID. It stopped everything.” It didn’t. It was negligent to think the wall could protect people on either side of the border from a virus. https://t.co/eiqjhFD3bG #BorderWall #NoBorderWall — Kenneth Madsen (@madsen34geog) July 21, 2020  During a Fox News interview with Chris Wallace, Trump made an absurd claim that the U.S. was protected from Coronavirus thanks to his border wall. Wallace was pressing Trump on the U.S. response to the pandemic and how it’s number one in both infections and deaths.  “But you take a look, why don’t they talk about Mexico? Which is not helping us. And all I can say is thank God I built most of the wall, because if I didn’t have the wall up we would have a much bigger problem with Mexico,” Trump told Chris Wallace.  However, Trump must be living in an alternate reality if he truly believes that his border wall has helped prevent the spread of Coronavirus into the country. The U.S. currently has 11 times more cases and far more deaths from the outbreak than Mexico. As of today, Johns Hopkins totaled more than 144,000 deaths and 3.97 million infections in the United States.  Then there’s the fact that the Trump administration has actually been very slow to build Trump’s vanity wall project. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), 245 miles of barrier have been built so far, including parts that replaced older barriers. That’s 245 miles of a 1,954 mile long border.  However, this wasn’t the first time that Trump has made such claims.  Long before Coronavirus had claimed it’s first known victim in the U.S., President Trump was already trying to connect the disease to the U.S.-Mexico border and his wall project.  At a rally in South Carolina on February 28, he argued that we needed to build more wall to keep the virus out, even though it was already in the country and spreading like wildfire.  “We must understand that border security is also health security,” Trump argued. “We will do everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering our country.”  That same day, the U.S. had 63 known cases of COVID-19, and Mexico announced its first two confirmed cases. Nevertheless, Trump and some of his allies have continued trying to frame illegal crossings of the Mexican border as a top potential source of coronavirus in the United States.  Just this month at a visit to an Arizona segment of the border wall, Trump tried to credit his new wall with stopping both undocumented immigration and the Coronavirus.  “It stopped COVID, it stopped everything,” Trump said.  His comments sparked outrage on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.  Trump is known for uttering complete falsehoods – he’s told more than 20,000 since taking office. But these comments about his wall protecting the U.S. from Coronavirus (as it rages within our borders) left many shocked.  In Mexico, President AMLO was asked about Trump’s assertion that construction of the border wall has prevented Coronavirus contagion coming north from Mexico. Although AMLO acknowledged he doesn’t agree with Trump, he also wouldn’t confront him.  “I respect President Trump’s point of view,” López Obrador told reporters during a daily press conference. “Of course I don’t share his opinion, but I’m not going to confront [Trump],” he added.  Both countries have been hit hard by the pandemic, but the U.S. leads the world in infections and deaths.  Mexican border states raise new concern about Americans bringing coronavirus south Mexico using Trump wall to keep out Americans with Trump virus https://t.co/Mpf7N6r3hz — Jerry Steinberg (@JerrySteinberg) July 4, 2020  It’s true that Mexico has also been hit hard by the pandemic. The country is currently ranked seventh globally in terms of the number of infections and fourth in number of deaths. As of July 22, Mexico has 356,255 confirmed Covid-19 cases and has suffered more than 40,000 deaths. Although those numbers are disheartening, they pale in comparison to the figures seen in the United States.  And although the virus has spread aggressively in both countries, Mexican governors of states that border the U.S. have called for stricter border controls to protect their residents. States along the southern border (including California, Arizona, and Texas) have become the new epicenter for the virus in the United States and Mexicans hope to prevent contagion into their states.

The debate debut for the former mayor of New York is poised to offer fresh insight into the sustainability of his unconventional campaign strategy — bypassing early voting states such as Nevada and spending hundreds of millions of dollars to spread his message on the airwaves.  Wednesday night’s debate comes at a pivotal point in the campaign as moderate voters are struggling to unify, with some increasingly looking to Mr Bloomberg to become the clear alternative to progressive Bernie Sanders.  All participants expect a hostile reception for Mr Bloomberg, who formally registered as a Democrat in 2018 and has faced relatively little national scrutiny so far in his surprisingly swift rise from a non-partisan major donor to a top-tier presidential contender.  My parents taught me about hard work, honesty, and sacrifice. Growing up in Medford, MA, I shoveled snow, cut lawns, and sold Christmas wreaths.

The stakes are just incredibly high for him.”  They are for others as well, just days before Nevada’s next-up presidential caucuses, the third contest in the Democrats’ chaotic 2020 primary season.  Voters will not formally judge Mr Bloomberg’s performance until next month.  He is not technically competing in Nevada’s Saturday caucuses or any of the four primary contests scheduled for this month, preferring to invest his time and resources in the delegate-rich states that begin voting in March.  In the modern era, such a strategy has never worked. Yet it’s never been attempted by someone as wealthy as Mr Bloomberg, who has already invested more than $400 million into a national advertising campaign and hired more than 2,000 campaign staffers.  Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speaks during a campaign event at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas on Tuesday (Patrick Semansky/AP)  After more than a year of campaigning there is little clarity in the search for a nominee to run against President Donald Trump in November.  Establishment favourite Joe Biden, a former two-term vice president, is fighting to breathe life into his flailing campaign, which enters the night at the bottom of a moderate muddle with former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar.  Mr Sanders, a Vermont senator, has emerged as the progressive wing’s clear preference after two contests as Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren struggles to boost her campaign.  Some Democrats fear conditions are ripe for a bare-knuckle brawl on national television that could carve new scars into a divided party.  Mr Bloomberg’s rivals have already indicated they will target his explosive comments on race and gender in addition to their charge that he’s using a fortune earned from a career on Wall Street to buy the presidency.  Mr Bloomberg’s rise in national polls has been fuelled almost exclusively by an unprecedented national advertising campaign, carefully controlled campaign events, and a sprawling national organisation that has likely already cost him more than half a billion dollars.  Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg (Matt York/AP)  Alexandra Rojas, executive director of the Sanders-allied Justice Democrats, called Wednesday Mr Bloomberg’s first “public moment of accountability.”  “It’s going to be a chance to finally bring scrutiny to Bloomberg’s record as a Republican plutocrat,” she said.  Despite the challenges, senior adviser Tim O’Brien signalled Mr Bloomberg welcomed a fight against Mr Sanders, perceived as the race’s clear front-runner, with questions on Mr Sanders’ personal wealth, record on criminal justice and gun control.  The Vermont senator railed against Bloomberg and “a system that allows billionaires to buy elections” while campaigning in Nevada on the eve of the debate.  “Here is the message: Anyone here worth $60 billion, you can run for president, and you can buy the airwaves,” Mr Sanders said.  “My friends, that is called oligarchy, not democracy.”  It's no secret that the billionaire class dominates our political and economic life.  To end poverty, homelessness, hunger and lead poisoning in America, the ultra-rich must pay their fair share. Even if that means buying fewer $89 million paintings and $70 million cars. pic.twitter.com/LAZBNhYad9 — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) February 19, 2020  While the same age and race, Mr Bloomberg and Mr Sanders are ideological opposites.  Mr Bloomberg is one of the world’s richest men, having generated a net worth estimated at $60 billion (£46 billion) after a career on Wall Street.  He has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to combat climate change and gun violence and promote immigration reform in recent years, yet he takes a decidedly pragmatic approach that celebrates incremental improvement backed by data.  Mr Sanders has a net worth estimated at $2.5 million (£1.9 million) thanks to book sales and the value of his home.

According to the notice, no fewer than 700 Nigerians have registered with the missions in the U.S. for evacuation, which will be done in batches.  It said that the first batch of 270 evacuees would be transported to Abuja through an Ethiopian Airlines flight ET 509.  The plane is expected to depart the Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey at 9.15p.m., and fly directly to the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.  As earlier announced by the Federal Government, the flight is at the expense of the evacuees, who will all fly economy class, according to the notice.  “The projected cost for the one-way economy ticket is between 1,300 dollars (N488,800) and 1,700 dollars (N639,200) per adult.  “Please note that over 700 Nigerian nationals have registered with our missions in the USA to be evacuated.  “However, only 270 passengers shall be accommodated in this batch of evacuation.  “Missions will, therefore, attend to applicants on a first come, first served basis and shall prioritise the list of evacuees according to their immigration status.  “This includes the need to consider those stranded with proof of short stay visas, the elderly, families with children and returning students,” it said.  In an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in New York, Okoyen said that the dates for subsequent batches would be announced in due course.  To curb the spread of COVID-19, the Federal Government on March 18 imposed restrictions on travels from 13 countries with high burdens.  The countries are China, Iran, South Korea, Germany, Italy, U.S. United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Netherlands, Spain, France, Japan, Australia and Sweden.  Consequently, many Nigerians, who were on short-term visits to the affected countries, became stranded.

New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who has declared a state of emergency, has said that he may have also been in contact with Cotton while he was contagious. And a string of Republican senators and congressmen all came in contact with at least one coronavirus patient at last week's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)—where attendees mocked the outbreak as an attempt by Democrats to smear Donald Trump. Some of those congressmen reportedly interacted with the president before they self-isolated.  One of those Republican congressmen was representative Paul Gosar of Arizona, formerly best-known as the man whose siblings put out a political ad telling people not to vote for him. When Gosar announced Sunday that he was entering self-isolation for 14 days—the period of time it takes to develop symptoms—he called the disease the \"Wuhan virus,\" a reference to the Chinese city where the outbreak originated—as of Tuesday, the disease has spread to more than 100 countries, and in the U.S. people have tested positive in 36 states and Washington, DC. In response to Gosar's comments, Democratic politicians and liberal groups chastised him, for using a racist phrase instead of the name scientists are using.  \"Coronavirus\" is an umbrella term that covers a lot of different viruses, from the common cold to SARS, which is why the resulting disease from this particular strain is referred to as Coronavirus Disease-2019, or COVID-19 for short. The WHO says the name \"was deliberately chosen to avoid stigmatization,\" and there are real consequences to linking COVID-19 to Chinese people. Just last week, A 23-year-old student from Singapore studying in London was attacked just by a man who reportedly said, \"I don't want your coronavirus in my country.\" Before that, the Asian American Journalists Association issued a statement asking news organizations \"to avoid fueling xenophobia and racism that have already emerged since the outbreak.\" Along with warning \"against blanket use of Chinatown images that reinforce stereotypes and create a sense of 'otherness,'\" the AAJA specifically referred to World Health Organization guidelines \"discouraging the use of geographic locations when naming illnesses because it could stigmatize the people living there.\" In fact, the WHO issued new guidelines specifically for COVID-19, saying explicitly, \"Don’t attach locations or ethnicity to the disease, this is not a 'Wuhan Virus,' 'Chinese Virus,' or 'Asian Virus.'\"  Gosar defended himself on Sunday, tweeting, \"Just astoundingly ignorant to have all major media refer to it as #WuhanVirus for months but somehow, today, you’ve decided that’s #racist.\" He added, \"Ignore the snowflake Leftists who think everything is racist. It's a virus. It doesn't care about your race.\"  But of course he's not the sole Republican trying to make that connection. Even the GOP leadership is ramping up the rhetoric. On Monday, Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader in the House of Representatives, tweeted, \"Everything you need to know about the Chinese coronavirus can be found on one, regularly-updated website,\" providing a link to the CDC's page on COVID-19, which doesn't feature the word \"Chinese\" anywhere. That tweet from the highest-ranking House republican is still up.  Conservative pundits have also been fanning xenophobia. On Sunday, right-wing radio host Hugh Hewitt claimed that it's necessary to link COVID-19 to China because the Chinese government doesn't want to be associated with the disease: \"Contrary to the absurd idea that #wuhanvirus is a racist term, it may be a necessary one to prevent an Orwellian rewrite of history underway by some in [China].\"  And on Tuesday, Charlie Kirk, the head of the conservative students group Turning Points USA, went even further, calling COVID-19 \"the China Virus.\" On Twitter, he cited it as a reason to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying, \"With China Virus spreading across the globe, the US stands a chance if we can control of our borders.\" Trump retweeted Kirk, saying, \"Going up fast. We need the Wall more than ever!\"  It's not clear why or how a border wall would do anything to prevent the spread of COVID-19, since all cases in the U.S. have been the result of international travel, not illegal border crossing. If anything, Trump's policy that asylum-seekers stay in migrant camps in Mexico while processing their (completely legal) asylum claims is far more likely to exacerbate the outbreak than a wall-less border. The Trump administration implemented the policy in the hopes that sufficiently miserable conditions will deter people from applying for asylum, but that plan hasn't worked. As a result of this entirely punitive policy, thousands of people have been living in makeshift camps for months, relying almost entirely on volunteers for medical assistance.  The Trump administration and its allies in Congress and conservative media haven't been shy about linking all sort of unrelated social problems to immigration—from low wages to violent crime. Blaming immigrants and foreigners for disease outbreak isn't out of character.  But Trump's xenophobic policies haven't protected Americans from COVID-19—in fact, it's hobbled the administration's ability to stop the spread. While other countries have rushed out widespread testing for the disease—Germany is using drive centers to give patients swabs and Chinese cities running low on test kits found ways to diagnose the disease via CT scans—Trump's first response to the outbreak in late January was to impose travel restrictions. Trump even bragged that he made those restrictions over the protests of his own public health officials, who stressed that testing people already in the U.S. would have a bigger impact than just trying to keep people out. And the U.S. still lags far behind where it needs to be with testing: as of March 8, only 1,700 tests had been conducted in the U.S., compared to 3,450 in Israel and 23,000 in the United Kingdom, both countries with a fraction of the U.S. population.  Trump supporters like Gosar and the president's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski say that a pandemic is no time to be \"political.\" And they're right. But the administration's xenophobia led it to once again target immigrants rather than actually deal with the problem.

Now the United States, which leads the world when it comes to incarceration, faces that same challenge.  It is essential to understand that, despite being physically secure, jails and prisons are not isolated from the community. People continuously enter and leave, including multiple shifts of corrections staff; newly arrested, charged and sentenced individuals; attorneys; and visitors. Even if this flow is limited to the extent possible, correctional facilities remain densely populated and poorly designed to prevent the inevitable rapid and widespread dissemination of this virus.   AD   AD  At the same time, jails and prisons house individuals at higher risk than in other settings, such as schools and restaurants, that have been closed to mitigate contamination. Although corrections facilities cannot be closed, they must be included in any plan aimed at slowing the surge in infections and protecting public safety.  Reassessing security and public health risks and acting immediately will save the lives of not only those incarcerated but also correctional staff and their families and the community at large. There are several steps that authorities should implement as quickly as possible.  They must screen incoming individuals to prevent and delay infected individuals from entering facilities. They must rapidly identify cases and isolate exposed groups to limit the spread, as well as quickly transfer seriously ill patients to appropriate facilities.  But that won’t be enough. Authorities should release those who do not pose an immediate danger to public safety, while also reducing arrests and delaying sentencings. These moves carry inherent political risks, but they are for the greater good of the public at large. The abrupt onset of severe covid-19 infections among incarcerated individuals will require mass transfers to local hospitals for intensive medical and ventilator care — highly expensive interventions that may soon be in very short supply. Each severely ill patient coming from corrections who occupies an ICU bed will mean others may die for inability to obtain care.   AD   AD  Our ability to release people rapidly will vary by type of facility and jurisdiction. Those being held in jails simply due to their inability to afford bail, or for minor infractions or violations, can generally be released promptly by the judiciary or even the local sheriff. Some jurisdictions are already discussing such mitigation efforts.  Already sentenced individuals pose a greater challenge — one compounded by the punitive policies of the past few decades (mandatory minimum sentences, three strikes and life without parole) that have led to a large, aging incarcerated population especially vulnerable to severe disease. Additionally, half of all incarcerated people suffer from at least one chronic illness, which means even more will be at risk of a poor prognosis if they become infected.  Those eligible for parole can and should be released. Provisions for “compassionate release/parole” exist in every state; however, that process is typically slow, underutilized and very limited. Fortunately, the people at highest risk for severe complications of covid-19 who are incarcerated (the aging and chronically ill), are, on average, the least likely to commit a new crime or need to be re-incarcerated. In some states, governors have the ability to commute sentences or pardon individuals, as does the president in the federal system.   AD   AD  On the federal level as well, there is a parallel public health danger lurking in the immigration detention system, where thousands of people are being held in jail-like conditions that pose similar risks. The Trump administration could, if it wished, institute a simple and even temporary policy change to release those individuals into the community rather than contain them in an environment where rapid spread is likely. As unlikely as this may be given the administration’s approach to immigration detention, this may be the easiest fix, given the broad discretion of the Department of Homeland Security to change policy.  The spread of the coronavirus may only be the tipping point for what can happen when we fail to consider all the costs and consequences of our system of mass incarceration. We justify locking people up to protect public safety. Yet public safety will be at even greater peril if we fail to mitigate risks associated with confining too many people in jails, prisons and detention facilities during a pandemic.

Associated Press  GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — Guatemala again began receiving deportation flights from the United States this week after a one-week pause prompted by three deportees testing positive for COVID-19.  The Guatemalan government had asked the United States to not send more than 25 deportees per flight, to give them health exams before departure and to certify that they were not infected.  However, the flights resumed Monday with 76 migrants aboard the first and 106 on the second. Guatemala’s foreign ministry did not immediately clarify why the U.S. had not complied with its requirements, but the flights came on the same day that the U.S. State Department announced that aid would continue to Guatemala and the other Northern Triangle countries.  At least three of the migrants who arrived Monday were taken directly to a hospital for COVID-19 testing. One of the flights also included 16 unaccompanied minors, according to the Guatemalan Immigration Institute. Citing the epidemic, the U.S. has started swiftly deporting unaccompanied minors rather than holding them in protective settings as specified by law.  Also on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that he had informed Congress that the U.S. government would continue assistance for Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras in order to continue to lower illegal immigration and accomplish other policy objectives.  Pompeo said that since illegal immigration from those three countries peaked in May 2019, “encounters” with migrants from those countries had fallen 76%. The U.S. government has effectively ended any possibility of seeking asylum at the southern border with emergency restrictions applied in the face of the epidemic.

During a reporter’s visit to Bangkok’s main international airport on Tuesday, a health official working at a quarantine checkpoint inside the airport’s arrival hall said every passenger, regardless of their flight origin, has to go through temperature scans before they can get their passports stamped.  “We still carry out thorough screenings for passengers arriving from China,” Thanawut Karapakdee said. “All flights from China are directed to a seperate concourse, where passengers will be screened one by one using thermal cameras to detect a fever and experts to look for any signs of symptoms.”  Not Coronavirus: Airport Says Tourist Collapses Because He Was Drunk  Earlier this week, a group of Thai students returning from China’s Hubei province wrote online that they did not see any health checkpoints when they landed at the airport on Sunday night.  But Thanawut said every passenger arriving on international flights has to go through a thermoscan in the area just before they enter immigration.  “We screen all passengers every day, not only when there’s an outbreak,” Thanawut said. “Passengers might have not noticed, but we have installed thermal cameras at the arrival hall before immigration checkpoint for years already.”  Disease control department director Suwanchai Watthanayingcharoenchai told the media the thermoscan device has been in place for three years now, but many might not have noticed it.  A quarantine officer screens passengers at the arrival hall before immigration checkpoint. Photo: Offta Nattapon / Facebook  Thanawut, the quarantine officer, said if anyone is suspected of catching the virus, the person will be escorted to an isolation room. The person will then be referred to an infectious diseases institute, where they will be placed in a specialized ward and undergo a test.  As of Tuesday afternoon, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Thailand rose to 14, though health officials said eight of them already recovered. Thanawut refused to disclose how many people were intercepted at the airport, but said his team contributed significantly to the number of cases found nationwide.  Thanawut said his team was falsely accused by social media of neglecting to screen incoming passengers – partly fanned by contradicting and confusing statements from different bureaucrats – until they took to Facebook themselves to explain the situation. The post was later shared more than 14,000 times.  “I didn’t think that many people would share my post,” he said. “I didn’t want to get attention, but I just wanted to refute fake news that accused us of not screening passengers after flights from Wuhan were banned. In fact, we’re still doing it round-the-clock.”  A quarantine officer uses a thermometer to check body temperature of a passenger.  Dubbed by netizens as the nation’s first line of defense, Thanawut said the team of around a dozen people are working for a 12-hour shift each day. The Ministry of Public Health and the Royal Thai Army also sent reinforcements to help them at the airport.  Although Thanawut said his friends and family are concerned for his safety, the public health official said he is proud of his duties.  “It’s my responsibility as a health quarantine officer,” Thanawut said. “I don’t fear the virus because I always wear protective apparel and exercise caution. In fact, I’m honored to put my knowledge into use and defend my country and family against the epidemic.”  He added, “It’s a challenging task to screen thousands of people. All we want from members of the public is trust and support since we’re all putting our best efforts into it.”  During a reporter’s visit to the airport, many passengers, mostly Asians, and airport staff wore face masks to protect themselves against the novel coronavirus.  Gloria Lai, a tourist from Hong Kong, said she’s still confident about coming to Thailand despite the number of confirmed infection cases in the kingdom.  “It’s OK because we have infected people in Hong Kong too,” Lai said. “I will wash my hands more frequently and wear a mask to protect myself.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 15, "positive": 18, "negative": 8, "disgust": 1, "joy": 3, "anger": 4, "fear": 9, "trust": 7}, "metadata": ["airport", "arriving", "china", "media", "quarantine", "scans", "passports", "students", "online", "checkpoints", "immigration", "isolation", "coronavirus", "screening", "ministry", "virus", "masks"]}, {"text": "Sir, – It is frequently said the SNP is not Scotland, and speaks and acts only for the SNP.

Racism in football could do lasting damage  Sir, – I was saddened to read about alleged racism at last week’s Dundee derby.  Suffice to say a player’s colour, religion or sexual preferences shouldn’t matter to any true football fan. What should matter is that players are fit, healthy and talented, and want to play for their team – and will do their best to be good ambassadors for their club off the field.  Like millions of others I love watching brilliant footballers such as Raheem Sterling, Romelu Lukaku, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford, to name just a few.  I hate to say it but, due to a combination of racism, religious bigotry and homophobia, I believe some values may become lost to the beautiful game.  A recent FA Cup match in England was abandoned due to a racist incident and, in other matches, play was suspended, and came within a whisker of being abandoned, under the “three warnings rule”.  The reality is professional football has become seriously expensive to watch with clubs such as Arsenal charging about £60 to watch a game.  Big teams in England often play to crowds of in excess of 60,000 for league games and I dare say if any big match gets abandoned, spectators won’t get a refund. It would definitely impact on the size of crowds if abandonments caused by race-related incidents become common.  Big matches are nearly always screened live by pay as you go television channels, and if suspensions of games under the three-warnings rule happen regularly it will seriously disrupt the scheduling of other television programmes.  That costs big money, too, and may cause television companies to stop offering lucrative contracts to screen live football.  All this would likely have an adverse impact on football as a business.  If that happens it could dissuade professional clubs from signing players from ethnic minorities because paying huge transfer fees to sign such players may be considered as too much of a business risk by football clubs if matches are abandoned or suspended on a regular basis.  Realistically what working man will risk paying £60 or more (with no chance of a refund) to watch a match that could end up being suspended or abandoned for reasons that have nothing to do with the weather? And what club could or would continue to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on transfer fees and wages for players that may, quite rightly, walk off the field of play?

Cynical flaws in health plan  Sir, – I have to agree with Harry Key (“Education is key in third world”, Letters, January 4) that clean water, education, doctors and nurses have done far more for the peoples of the world than all the Christian missionaries.  But I suspect if Boris Johnson is to achieve his recruitment promises for health professionals in the UK we should perhaps brace ourselves for a resurgence in the exodus of Christian missionaries keen to refill the gaps left by these incoming health professionals.  It is utterly cynical to expect shortfalls in our NHS staffing, created by austerity policies of successive governments, to be addressed now by recruitment from outside the UK, particularly if such recruitment is targeted at healthcare professionals whose education has been paid for and who are working in societies where health care standards are generally well below those we enjoy here.  It is equally cynical to have an immigration policy directed solely at what the government identifies as desirable professions, but which excludes those with lesser skills whose contribution to our society, economy and welfare is just as valuable.

My grandfather, George Henderson, was a missionary in India, but began to realise his wife (my grandmother) was helping the local people more in her role as a midwife and, at the age of 40, decided to return to Scotland to train as a doctor.  He subsequently built and established a leprosy hospital in rural India  Although he may have saved some souls with his ministry, I’m certain he saved and improved more lives with his medicine.   Edie Allan.   Mansefield,   Tealing.  Caring for others a team effort  Sir, – In reply to Harry Key of Largoward (Letters, January 4), medical staff and Christian missionaries are not mutually exclusive.  It is not one or the other, and some Christians, as at the Steeple Church in Dundee, are also doctors.  My mother had Parkinson’s Disease for a long time.  By 2012 she had carers coming in, neighbours coming in and medics looking after her, eventually at St Andrews Community Hospital hospice unit.  The local church – the people not the building – were very supportive.  Doubtless these people were also nationalists, unionists, leave and remain voters working together, which makes me very angry when I hear political leaders talk about a divisive Scottish independence referendum in 2014.  We all have a part in ending division.   Peter Ovenstone.   6 Orchard Grove,   Peterhead.  This is what Scotland rejects  Sir, – A quite astonishing letter from Douglas Cowe (“Gentle persuasion won’t win Indy argument”, Letters, January 2).  He lambasts the SNP for not providing “the people of Scotland with realistic, costed, economic facts and figures”, goes on to say that “Scotland will endure decades of austerity, reduced services and increased taxes…and supporters seem not to care, (they) are happy to commit my country to an isolated, backward, economically challenged regime…sensible, responsible, patriotic Scots (should) ensure that our people are not harmed by this senseless, reckless behaviour”.  Does this not describe, very accurately, what the people of Scotland voted decisively to reject in the 2016 Brexit referendum, and again overwhelmingly dismissed in the recent general election?  Yet it is being imposed upon us by the Westminster Conservative Government which achieved only six out of 59 seats in Scotland.

Industry specialists say while New Zealand's tourism, retail and hospitality industries will struggle, the tech and film industries could lure a fresh wave of investors and entrepreneurs here.  Particularly in the tech sector, where, while not immune from the economic downturn, the message is one of adaptability and resilience — that New Zealand has the infrastructure and the capability to maximise its position, both as a place where innovation and entrepreneurs can thrive, and where international talent can look to set up camp.  * NZ tech company Datacom is much bigger than Xero, but keeps a low profile  * Callaghan Innovation $75m boost to benefit all businesses – Govt  * How to pick a 'unicorn' and what it takes for a startup to become one  Abigail Dougherty/Stuff Athena X Ventures founder Dil Khosa got to work right away during the lockdown, linking innovators with one another.  \"Someone super wise said to me recently that this could be New Zealand's chance to be a phoenix rising from the ashes, if we use the opportunity right,\" Auckland entrepreneur Dil Khosa says. \"We got through the health pandemic (and) we have a head start(on) digitising lots of our sectors for efficiency and building new tech-enabled ways to run our domestic industries.\"  During the lockdown Khosa, founder of Athena X Ventures, launched Breaking through the Pandemic, an online platform to help innovators connect and build skills.

Investors are certainly eager to move here, it's a matter of when they will be allowed to come and invest in our start-ups.\"  Callaghan Innovation chief executive Vic Crone says the pandemic has \"absolutely\" provided an opportunity \"and we know from previous recessions that technology has played a real role to shape organisations and the economy as they move forward\".  Its survey of 775 businesses showed nearly 60 per cent thought the pandemic provided the possibility to accelerate their work or seize new opportunities (40 per cent reported cash flow was their biggest barrier).  While the rest of the country has grappled with new working from home scenarios, adapting their businesses to ensure online connectivity, Crone says tech has \"been sitting there waiting for this level of awakening to happen\".  \"The challenge is cash. They need government support. They need investors to stay with them. [And] they need access to talent.\"  Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment figures show that although Immigration NZ wasn't able to process new visas, there remained a steady interest, and applications for, its entrepreneur, investor and global impact visas. During the eight week lockdown it received 25 applications, with most for the investor 2 category visa - experienced business people with a minimum of $3 million in assets or funds. Google registered spikes in people searching for information about immigrating to New Zealand.  The-Dominion-Post New Zealanders can create world class product exports, without having to move anything offshore, say experts.  Yoseph Ayele, chief executive and co-founder of the Edmund Hillary Fellowship, a programme which aims to attract and unite entrepreneurs, investors and start-up teams in New Zealand, says it received a record near-500 applications between January to April, which included top global entrepreneurs and investors seeking to relocate.  While Covid-19 was \"definitely\" a contributor, the ongoing interest in New Zealand was not just virus-related, he said. Covid-19 had created an environment where the economy could begin transitioning into a more productive model, that was \"extremely attractive\" to global entrepreneurs and investors.  New and innovative industries - including tech - would help transition the country to its next chapter, which would also help generate new types of economic activity, he said.  While sectors like tourism and international education had displaced workers from jobs, there was an opportunity to re-train people into new industries which could provide more fulfilling lives - one with greater productivity, increased sustainability and a heightened social footprint.  People working in regions, for example, could be earning city-level income with agribusiness innovation opportunities, Ayele said. Elsewhere, blockchain technologies could be harnessed for opportunity in the financial tech sector.  \"We need to invest in those high-risk, long-term opportunities.\"  International business consultant Phil O'Reilly said New Zealand had a 90-day window to capitalise on the reputation of being Covid-free.  The country already had a big reputation internationally and this had burnished it.  But unless New Zealand opened its borders soon, the opportunity would be squandered.  A \"smart border\" was the answer; that meant a rapid contact tracing system, and sophisticated health checks, both ahead of departure and on arrival.  Officials have been working on a national contact tracing system and an announcement is understood to be imminent.  But the Government has sounded a note of caution about reopening the borders too soon; even a much touted trans-Tasman \"bubble\" could be months, rather than weeks, away.

Max Olson, the 26-year-old founder and chief executive of Whangārei-based FreightFish, an ocean carrier offering high-speed freight services using ships it designs and builds in-house, says there is \"no question\" New Zealand's future is in tech, \"but we have a long way to go before we catch up with Silicon Valley\".  Olson says both local and overseas investment - largely uncertain at the moment - would be key moving forward. But how New Zealand has dealt with the virus may give some optimism to international investors.  Money was only part of the problem: good governance, mentorship and coaching would be needed. Jobs that Kiwis wanted and were excited to do were needed.  \"There's a lot of great talent coming on to the labour market. Start-ups that [need] labour may be able to take advantage of [the situation] and pick up that workforce that has fallen in these hard times.\"  Director of Taupō-based NuCleer, Gavin Watson, says while the pandemic has put the business back a few months, there was a lot of interest in start-ups being able to get base products off the ground.  \"I think our future is in the IP and the tech brains working things out, and not manufacturing [products] ourselves. We've got a good track record as a country being innovators, but it's too difficult to compete [with manufacturing] on a large scale, particularly in the global market with the high costs of labour and our geographical distance.\"  Dominion-Post Kirk Hope, chief executive of Business NZ, says tech and the film industry could be where New Zealand's future lies.  The focus moving forward should be quickly getting designs to market. \"New Zealand has a pretty good record with innovation, but also a big failure rate getting [product] to market.\"  Atrax Group managing director Kevin Maurice agrees. While Atrax is far from start-up - he's been in business for over 30 years - the company's airport baggage and cargo scales are among the most in demand in the world. He says there are silver linings for New Zealand, but we needed to back ourselves: \"Sometimes it's easier to sell offshore, and then you gain credibility in New Zealand.\"  Business New Zealand chief executive Kirk Hope is hopeful for the future. He believes there's been renewed interest in New Zealand as a destination for film producers, entrepreneurs, and international students.  This week the New Zealand Film Commission boss, chief executive Annabelle Sheehan, said it was in discussion with \"a lot of different international studios\" including US film and streaming services.  Stuff-co-nz Weta Digital worked on Avengers: Endgame, pictured. It's been in conversations with international counterparts during lockdown.  Weta Digital is working on Avatar sequels, with The Lord of the Rings and several Netflix projects in the pipeline for release later this year, and new projects awarded to the studio post lockdown is giving it cautious optimism moving forward.  \"We see this in the increasing number of meetings we're setting with film producers looking to make their movies across a number of types of formats, including some filmmakers who hadn't previously considered Weta Digital or New Zealand as a potential solution,\" says executive producer David Conley.  \"These conversations have substantially picked up in volume as producers see New Zealand and its supporting infrastructure being one of the few places around the globe able to safely open for production.\"  A boost to the film industry could supercharge others like hospitality, construction and catering, he says, and the inspiration of seeing New Zealand scenes on the big screen could also accelerate visitor numbers down the line.  Border restrictions presented difficulty, which producers were willing to overcome, but there was also challenge in sustaining, growing, and modernising the screen infrastructure with support from local and central government.  \"New Zealand has a window of opportunity to build off what will be an increase in content production across the globe. Our industry cannot afford to lose the expertise accrued over the last two decades as a result of economic attrition.\"  Hope says New Zealand's opportunity for growth is now, and points to the benefit of some tech infrastructure already invested in which has helped us ride out the turbulent time — ultra-fast broadband, for example.  Jason Dorday/Stuff With New Zealand's border closed experts say we need to create weightless products that we can export.  He says it's critical that to maximise the opportunity, New Zealand's digital gap is closed, that the border is safely reopened to skilled workers who could be quarantined, and Kiwis' digital skills are \"turbo boosted\".  \"But I think the point I'd make is that we're in a better position to weather a crisis than we've ever been. A lot of people move to New Zealand because of our lifestyle and given we have managed the public health crises, we can continue to have a pretty good lifestyle — they're coming from areas where their lifestyle is more complicated.\"  Memia director Ben Reid, in his former capacity at the helm of the Artificial Intelligence forum, was encouraging officials to look to tech long before the pandemic saw the country shut down. To the Productivity Commission's inquiry into the future of work, he submitted the traditional fear that tech will replace jobs needed to be trumped by the confidence that it would create them.  He says the current climate represents a \"huge opportunity\" to export weightless services that don't require people to cross borders. While the tech sector wasn't immune to a recession - cash flow could be a problem - he saw the times as a potential economic boon.  \"We have a healthy and growing tech sector that is able to basically open for business in an overseas market, in New Zealand. We're now even more attractive to work in because we have a functioning economy, we're not going to have years of disruption. We can attract talent. People like doing business with Kiwis. We have some of the smartest people in the world.\"  The challenge was harnessing the opportunity, training people up — potentially people who found themselves considering new careers could find work or training for themselves in tech.  \"We really need to think very carefully about what our future is going to look like, and it's not going to be moving product from one end of the country to the other, it's going to be about creating weightless, intellectual property services, and selling them to overseas markets.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 48, "joy": 8, "negative": 7, "disgust": 2, "positive": 74, "anger": 14, "surprise": 4, "fear": 14, "trust": 7}, "metadata": ["zealand", "tech", "globe", "pandemic", "lauded", "ministry", "immune", "economic", "infrastructure", "innovation", "nz", "boost", "online", "organisations", "economy", "ensure", "immigration", "global", "hillary", "ongoing", "education", "displaced", "borders", "reopening", "virus", "geographical", "managing", "airport", "david", "crisis", "climate"]}, {"text": "Mumbai Airport authorities have taken several preventive and precatutionary measures to ensure passenger safety after the resumption of operations. (Photo: PTI)  While the Central government is yet to set a date for the resumption of flight operations, airports across India, presuming an early announcement, have already put several measures in place and are ready to welcome passengers.  On Saturday Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) said that it had put together several measures to curb the spread of coronavirus and added that its Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (CSIA) is ready for operations.  India Today TV has learnt that the airport officials have formulated Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the safety of passengers. Other than continuous sanitisation of the spaces and maintaining social distancing norms, the post lockdown measures will also include compulsory thermal screening.  The airport will also set up temporary quarantine centres at both its terminals.  Post the government announcing a date for resumption of domestic and international flight services, here's what passengers can expect at the Mumbai International Airport:  1. Distinctive markings at both the terminals  2. Markings will be at the entry gate, check-in counters, self-check-in kiosks, security checkpoints, food courts, lounge area, and the boarding area amongst others  3. Passengers will be maintaining a 1.5 meters distance between each other  4. Sitting arrangements at the food court and terminal building have been rearranged  5. Screening will be conducted before anyone enters the terminal building  6. Those who show symptoms will be immediately taken to quarantine facilities  7. Hand sanitisers will be at all the touchpoints  8. Airport personnel will assist passengers with boarding copy  Speaking to India Today TV, an MIAL spokesperson said, \"We are all geared up to welcome the passengers. The airport will be operating as usual with additional of prevention and precautionary measures to be followed for our own safety. We are sure the passengers are equally excited to take the flight to the respective destinations as before.\"  Other than these measures, the passengers on their part will be expected to wear masks and hand gloves throughout the flight duration.  The Mumbai Airport spokesperson said that the airport cleaning staff have been well trained to ensure effective cleaning procedures and to sanitise and disinfect the terminal buildings including the important places such as elevator buttons, escalators, and immigration counters.  In the initial stages of resumption of operations, the Mumbai Airport will be operating with 50 per cent of its total staff as per the directives from the Government of India.

While on the show, the 27-year-old rapper also spoke on his immigration case.  The rapper was arrested early last year by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under claims that he was an “unlawfully present United Kingdom national” who overstayed a visa that was only good for one year. Fortunately, 21 Savage was released but the rap star shared that the case is still ongoing and it's a real possibility that he could still be deported.  While he was doubtful that he’d be forced to leave the country, 21 Savage noted that he’d be in great financial shape regardless. In fact, the Atlanta-based rapper already has a contingency plan in mind.  “I don’t think that they gon’ do that,” he said. “But if they do, my money is going with me fa’ sho’. I’ll be alright. The money goes where [I] go. They got rich people over there [in the UK]. I’mma be one of them.”  He went on to joke that he would have all of his homies move with him overseas, adding, “Everybody gon’ want to come. They [are] not letting me go by myself.” On a more serious note, 21 Savage opened up about how the threat of deportation was one of the many obstacles he had to overcome as an immigrant in this country.  “People don’t know [what it's] like growing up in the hood and an immigrant. No matter what, you can’t go to college. You can’t get no license. You can’t get no job,” he explained. “My momma used to be scared to drive. Scared, but she had to drive. No license” he said. “My momma ain’t never had a license till I was probably like 24, 25 when I got some money and got her s**t straight.”  He continued, “Our struggle was different. It wasn’t no other option. I couldn’t go get a job. I couldn’t go to college. I couldn’t get a license. I just got my license when I was like 25, 26 years old.”  RELATED: 21 Savage Speaks Out In First Interview Since ICE Detainment  The rapper shared that he was touched by the support he saw from his peers during his legal ordeal. At the time of his arrest, Cardi B, Meek Mill, Vince Staples, Killer Mike tweeted out in support of his freedom. “When I got out, I really started to see all the love, and I'm like, ‘Damn, that's crazy,’” he said. “And I noticed all the fake love too, all the [people] who didn't show love. “So if you wondering why I've been stiff on you since I got out, it's 'cause you did not say ‘Free me!’”  RELATED: Hip Hop Shows Support For 21 Savage Following ICE Arrest  Most notably, Jay-Z hired immigration lawyer Alex Shapiro to help with his case. When he was released, 21 Savage visited the Roc Nation mogul to express his appreciation.  “When I got out, I pulled up on Jay-Z at his house. Him and Beyoncé were in there. And we were kicking it. I just was thanking him,” 21 Savage said. “When I first got out, I texted him like, ‘I’mma pay you back.’ He was like, ‘I don't want your money.’ He said, ‘Pay me back by being great.’ So I pulled up on him, chopped it up, just thanked him and s**t like that, 'cause he ain't have to do that.”  Watch 21 Savage's Big Facts interview in full below.

His role is spelled out in the Constitution.  It says that the chief justice \"shall preside\" over the Senate trial of a president. Those who envision a powerful role for Roberts point to Senate rules that would allow him to make decisions on \"all questions of evidence.\" In theory, at least, that might enable Roberts to rule on motions from the House managers seeking to compel testimony from White House aides, like former national security adviser John Bolton, and others who had been blocked by Trump from testifying.  Yet under Senate rules, it is the senators themselves who have the first and last word. They establish the procedures for the trial and can, by majority vote, overturn any of the chief justice's rulings. The extent of the chief's powerlessness was driven home to Chief Justice William Rehnquist at the beginning of President Bill Clinton's Senate impeachment trial in 1999.  When Rehnquist asked Senate Sergeant at Arms James Ziglar how to turn on his microphone, Ziglar replied, \"You don't. We control that.\"  \"I don't know if 'shock' is the right word,\" Ziglar recalls, but Rehnquist certainly had \"a sense of dismay\" that even though he was going to be the presiding officer at the trial, \"he really had absolutely no control of his courtroom.\"  The Clinton trial was conducted in a far different time. Republican Majority Leader Trent Lott and Democratic Minority Leader Tom Daschle worked closely to conduct the trial in a dignified way, and the rules for the trial were ultimately established by consensus and a unanimous Senate vote. Clinton, while controversial, had never attacked the Supreme Court or the chief justice personally, and the high court membership itself had remained stable for five years, without change.  None of that is true today.  Trump's relationship with Roberts has been rocky at best. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump called Roberts a \"disgrace,\" a \"disaster\" and a \"nightmare\" and castigated him repeatedly for casting the deciding vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act.  Although the president and Roberts have been cordial in their personal interactions in public since then, Trump has repeatedly cast aspersions on the integrity of federal judges for decisions he disagreed with, a practice that finally prompted a rare rebuke from Roberts and, of course, a snarky tweet from Trump firing back at the chief justice.  Roberts, a conservative appointed to the court by President George W. Bush almost 15 years ago, has tried mightily to convey an image of the court as apolitical. As he put it last year: \"We do not speak for the people, but we speak for the Constitution. Our role is very clear. We are to interpret the Constitution and laws of the United States and ensure that the political branches act within them. That job obviously requires independence from the political branches.\"  But that image has proved harder to maintain, as the court, with the addition of two Trump-appointed justices, has swerved to the right, with the promise of an even more dramatic conservative turn in the near future.  Even as Roberts will be presiding over the Senate trial, he and fellow justices are hearing a series of blockbuster cases this term on issues as diverse as abortion, LGBTQ employment rights, a major immigration case involving the potential deportation of 700,000 \"DREAMers,\" and even a series of cases in which Trump is seeking to block subpoenas of his financial records.  With that menu dominating his day job, it is unlikely that Roberts will want to insert himself as a major player in the impeachment trial.   Loading...  Rather, he is likely to use as his role model the man he once clerked for, Rehnquist. Rehnquist was no stranger to the subject of impeachment. He had written a book about the 1868 impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, and just five years before presiding over the Clinton trial in the Senate, he had written the Supreme Court's decision declaring that under the Constitution, the courts have no power to dictate the Senate rules in an impeachment proceeding.  As the presiding officer at the Clinton trial, Rehnquist relied heavily on the Senate parliamentarians for guidance. \"I think he enjoyed sort of being part of history in that sense. But he understood he had a very limited role,\" says Robert Schaffer, one of Rehnquist's law clerks back then.  Washington University law professor Neil Richards, another former clerk, recalls that \"no matter how boring or tedious the proceedings,\" the chief justice knew that even that limited role was important.  On a few occasions, Rehnquist did make rulings, none of them overturned by the senators. When Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa objected to one of the lawyers referring to the senators as jurors, Rehnquist replied this way: \"The chair is of the view that the objection ... is well taken, that the Senate is not simply a jury; it is a court in this case. Therefore counsel should refrain from referring to the senators as jurors.\"  Former Senate Sergeant at Arms Ziglar, who had once served as a Supreme Court law clerk himself, remembers that Rehnquist was often \"grumpy\" about the unplanned breaks that were supposed to be brief but often lasted for one or two hours. So Ziglar took the chief justice to lunch.  \"And I said to him, 'Chief, what can I do to make you less grumpy?' And he said, 'Well, I love cookies-and-cream ice cream ... and chocolate chip cookies.' \" After that, whenever there was a break, Ziglar would trigger the call for ice cream and cookies, and it seemed to work.  Not enough, though, to deal with the boredom of those unplanned breaks. On one occasion, Ziglar found the chief, with his three clerks, sitting in shirtsleeves in the ornate gilded room assigned to them during the trial. They were playing poker.  \"I looked at him and smiled,\" recalls Ziglar.  \"You may not know this,\" Ziglar gently told the chief justice, \"but I'm also the chief law enforcement officer in the Senate,\" and gambling is illegal here.  Ziglar told the card players he needed to do something for a few minutes but would be back shortly. Then he went outside the room, waited and came back in five minutes.  \"When I walked back in, the cards were still on the table,\" he says with a chortle, \"but instead of nickels and dimes and pennies, there were little pieces of paper on which was written, 1, 5 and 10.\"  Roberts may find the going a lot less boring in the upcoming Senate trial, especially if the rules are often in dispute. Word is that he, like Rehnquist before him, has asked that on court days, the trial begin at 1 in the afternoon so that Roberts can preside over oral arguments at the court in the morning.  In addition, the chief justice will have a very full plate of work, including writing his share of opinions, doing the administrative work of the court, and conducting his other duties as essentially the head of the federal judiciary.  He likely will aspire to Rehnquist's puckish evaluation of his own role in the 1999 Senate trial. Borrowing a line from Gilbert and Sullivan's play Iolanthe, Rehnquist opined, \"I did nothing in particular and did it very well.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 13, "positive": 41, "negative": 17, "disgust": 2, "joy": 7, "anger": 16, "surprise": 6, "fear": 4, "trust": 24}, "metadata": ["senate", "impeachment", "trump", "john", "adviser", "clinton", "democratic", "tom", "ultimately", "supreme", "presidential", "repeatedly", "uphold", "affordable", "tweet", "conservative", "united", "ensure", "term", "lgbtq", "immigration", "deportation", "subpoenas", "dominating", "andrew", "court's", "robert", "washington", "university", "professor", "counsel", "illegal", "cards", "arguments", "conducting"]}, {"text": "A Saudi dissident who fled to Europe was forced to go to court in Germany to gain political asylum after immigration officials sat on his case for more than 18 months.  Rasheed Alameer, a 35-year-old medical doctor who left Saudi Arabia in 2018, was finally granted refugee status in March within days of filing a legal complaint against the German government over the delay.  Dead, detained or disappeared: A who’s who of Mohammed bin Salman’s victims Read More »  A court in the city of Magdeburg compelled the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees to make a decision in Alameer's case on the grounds that it had failed to act within a reasonable time frame.  Alameer told Middle East Eye he was left in a state of uncertainty by German authorities at a time when Saudi exiles were living in fear in the aftermath of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and reported security threats against other dissidents opposed to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.   'A dangerous precedent'  He said he was not aware of any other asylum seekers who'd had to wait as long in Germany for their cases to be resolved.  “Allowing this delay would have set a dangerous precedent, allowing Germany or other governments in Europe to take as long as they want to decide on asylum cases,” he said.  “I did not want this precedent to be set to avoid putting future asylum seekers, particularly those from Saudi Arabia, in such a difficult situation.  “I am happy that future asylum seekers can cite this case if they find themselves in such a position where the migration office won't deliver a decision.”  EXCLUSIVE: Saudi dissidents in US warned by FBI after Khashoggi killing Read More »  Alameer, who is originally from Jazan in southwestern Saudi Arabia and describes himself as a political dissident and activist, believes he is at risk of being tortured if he is forced to return to his homeland.  He turned to activism as a student in Saudi Arabia but said it is not safe to call for political reform from within the kingdom.  \"The country needs people and movements that explicitly call and work towards political reform. But such work cannot happen from the inside otherwise you will immediately be imprisoned and tortured,\" he said.  While in Germany he said he had received messages from the Saudi government offering him a guarantee of security and other incentives to return. He said he had not responded to these and had shared them with the German police and security services.  Alameer said the messages were evidence that he was being pursued by the Saudi government.  The messages appear consistent with those received by other exiles at a time when Saudi authorities were seeking to lure them home in an apparent effort to silence them, and some were being contacted by security services in the US and other countries over concerns that their lives could be in danger.   Murder squad  In July 2018, MEE reported on the case of Prince Khaled bin Farhan, a dissident member of the Saudi royal family, who said he had been offered a seat on the private plane of a senior royal on an official visit to Germany in an attempt to entice him home.  Prince Khaled was granted political asylum within two months of arriving by the German authorities, such was their assessment of the danger of abduction.  He has was also told by German intelligence that his security outside the country could not be guaranteed, even within the EU.  Alameer flew to Europe in mid-2018 on a German visa and initially tried to claim asylum in Norway.  He was deported from Norway to Germany on 28 August 2018 because of the Dublin agreement, which requires those travelling to the European Union and EU-aligned countries to claim asylum in the country where they arrive or for which they have visas.  Alameer claimed asylum in Germany on 10 September 2018. He said the first hearing in his case took place on 2 October 2018, the same day of Khashoggi's disappearance after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.  “The minute I walked out I heard that Khashoggi had disappeared,” Alameer recalled.  The Saudi journalist was subsequently revealed to have been killed by a murder squad in an operation which the CIA and a United Nations investigation have linked to Mohammed bin Salman.   'I feel safe'  Alameer told MEE that he had been required to report regularly to a refugee reception centre where he was technically a resident for 18 months after claiming asylum, even though he had been allowed to stay in a hotel.  At the time of his arrival, the maximum period that asylum seekers could be held or required to report to a reception centre was six months, but the German parliament extended the length of time to 18 months during 2019.  Alameer filed his court case on 8 March and was notified that he had been granted asylum on 24 March. He now has German residency status.  “So long as I am in Germany I feel safe,” he said.  A spokesperson told MEE that the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees could not comment on individual asylum cases for privacy and data protection reasons.

Speaking during a CNN town hall Thursday night, the Massachusetts senator kept up the pressure on the billionaire businessman by drawing on her experience as an attorney and law professor and writing up her own version of a 'release and covenant not to sue' for Bloomberg to sign and release any of his past employees from their NDAs. 'I thought I'd make it easy,' she said.  Bloomberg came under fire from Warren and other candidates during Wednesday night's debate over NDAs signed by past employees and allegations that he made sexist comments and fostered a sexist culture at his company. Bloomberg said he would not release employees from those agreements, and dismissed any complaints about his past remarks as employees possibly taking a 'joke' he made the wrong way. On Thursday night, Warren said that his response 'just doesn't cut it,' and that if Bloomberg is unwilling to 'remove those gags, and let those women and maybe those men talk, then he is disqualified' from being president. But she said she'd vote for Bloomberg if he became the nominee.   5:50 p.m.  Joe Biden is pledging not to run for a second term if he's not healthy enough to do the job of president. Speaking at a CNN town hall Thursday night, Biden, who is 77 years old, told a questioner concerned about his age he would not outright commit to only running for one term.  Any candidate who offers that promise, he said, 'is already behind the 8 ball because then you're a one term president, and no one worries what's gonna happen after that.'  But he added: 'If anything changed in my health, making it incapable of me to fully exert all the energy and mental acuity that was needed to be done, then I give you my word: I would not run again.'  Biden released a doctor's report in December that described him as 'healthy, vigorous' and 'fit to execute the duties of the presidency.'

At a CNN town hall Wednesday night Biden said that he knew there was foreign meddling in elections while he was Vice President and 'I guarantee you (Russians) are involved' in the current election. Biden also said he suspected whomever briefed Congress on the interference 'is about to be fired.'  He added that 'I guarantee you' other foreign actors are interfering and said he'd stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, pledging to make sure 'there's consequences for his actions \" economic consequences.'  Biden also panned Trump's pick for Director of National Intelligence, Richard Grenell, who is currently serving as Ambassador to Germany. 'He has absolutely zero experience in intelligence,' he said.   4 p.m.  Former Vice President Joe Biden has picked up the endorsement of a prominent progressive Hispanic organization ahead of Saturday's caucus in Nevada.  The Latino Victory Fund announced Thursday that it was endorsing Biden. The group had endorsed former Obama administration housing chief Julián Castro in August, but he left the presidential race last month.  It timed its announcement to impact both Nevada and many of the Hispanic-heavy states voting on 'Super Tuesday' on March 3. Cristobal Alex headed Latino Victory until last March but now is a senior adviser to Biden's campaign.  Latino Victory Chairman Luis Miranda Jr. said in a statement that Biden 'has consistently supported issues that align with the Latino community.'  Miranda added that, if elected, Biden will work with Congress to promote comprehensive immigration reform and to protect so-called 'Dreamers,' or people brought to the U.S. illegally as children \" both issues where Biden's views overlap with his top Democratic presidential contenders.

At an emotional event with gun control activists Biden said 'too many Republicans and some Democrats like Bernie Sanders voted \" five times \" against the Brady Bill.'  Biden called politicians who opposed gun control 'cowards' but would not respond to reporters' questions whether he thought Sanders was a coward.  Asked whether Biden accepts Sanders' statements that he's changed his mind on gun control, Biden answered: 'I do think he's changed his views and I'm happy about that.'  Biden's broadside at Sanders came as the campaign released a web video of Sanders telling a radio caller after the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre that allowing people to sue gun manufacturers would do no good. Biden alluded to Sanders' support for a 2005 law immunizing gun manufacturers from lawsuits at Wednesday night's debate.   ___   12 p.m.  Elizabeth Warren is digging into her attacks on Mike Bloomberg a day after her sharp barbs left the New York billionaire on his heels in the Democratic debate.

'I have really had it with billionaires, regardless of party, who think that the rules don't apply to them,' Warren said.  Warren pressed Bloomberg at the debate to say how many nondisclosure agreements his company has signed preventing women from talking about complaints of harassment.

Bannon was among several people charged with wire fraud in an indictment by federal prosecutors in Manhattan for allegedly defrauding hundreds of thousands of donors through a US$25 million (S$34 million) crowdfunding campaign called \"We Build the Wall\".  \"As alleged, the defendants defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors, capitalising on their interest in funding a border wall to raise millions of dollars, under the false pretence that all of that money would be spent on construction,\" US attorney Audrey Strauss said in a press release yesterday, reported Bloomberg.  Prosecutors said Bannon received more than US$1 million of that money through a non-profit organisation. MSNBC reported that Bannon is expected to plead not guilty to the charges.  As a top adviser to Mr Trump's presidential campaign who later served as chief White House strategist, Bannon helped articulate the right-wing populism and fierce opposition to immigration that have helped define Mr Trump's 31/2 years in office.  Bannon left the White House in August 2017, reported Reuters.  Mr Trump's signature effort to build a wall along the US-Mexico border - a key 2016 campaign promise - has struggled amid court challenges, logistical hurdles and opposition from Democrats in Congress.  In the meantime, more than 330,000 supporters have donated to private fund-raisers and profiteers who have promised to build the wall on their own, according to a 2019 Reuters investigation.  Those efforts likewise have met with limited success.  The indictment comes as Mr Trump trails in opinion polls behind Democratic challenger Joe Biden ahead of the Nov 3 presidential election.  A spokesman for Bannon could not be immediately reached for comment.  Also charged were Brian Kolfage, Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea.  Kolfage, who prosecutors described as the public face and founder of the operation, received thousands of dollars that he used to fund a lavish lifestyle.  Kolfage was due to appear in federal court yesterday in Florida, while Bannon was set to appear in federal court in Manhattan.  The other two defendants were due to appear in courts in the Middle District of Florida and Colorado.  Website Axios reported that Bannon is the sixth person linked to the 2016 Trump campaign to be hit with federal charges.  The others are Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, Rick Gates, Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen.

This, Mr. Stein thought, was a problem that economists could help solve: A “market” in ventilators — in which hospitals in states with ventilators to spare lent them or rented them to hospitals in needy states — could help ease shortfalls and perhaps save millions of lives. This market doesn’t exist, though, because there is no enforceable rule or covenant — what economists call a commitment device — that ensures that needy states would give them back.  “Commitment problems are important in the world of economics,” Mr. Stein noted.

Epidemiologists, virologists and other health experts are throwing everything they have at understanding the new coronavirus, hoping to develop treatments, vaccines and strategies to slow its spread and limit its toll.

The appointment of Farooq Mitha, a longtime Biden supporter and former Muslim advisor to the Clinton campaign in 2016, comes after weeks of pressure to remove Amit Jani as coordinator given his strong ties with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) party.  Over the last 10 days, at least two petitions have been circulating calling on Jani to be removed from the White House Democratic hopeful's campaign team.  Last week, several Muslim-American political advisors were approached to help find a new Muslim aide in a process reportedly led in part by Mitha.  The Biden campaign has yet to officially announce Mitha's appointment, but Middle East Eye understands that Jani will continue in his current role as the campaign's Asian-American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) national vote director.  Sources close to the campaign told MEE that Biden's aides would not want to risk alienating Hindu- Americans by removing Jani from staff.  Mitha directed all queries from MEE to Biden's press team, who did not respond to multiple requests for comment.   'Cosmetic staffing changes'  Mitha's appointment, revealed by The Muslim Observer on Sunday, has failed to satisfy the demands of many South Asian activists who say that Biden's campaign needs to sever all ties with individuals linked to right-wing movements.  Sharmin Hossain, the political director of Equality Labs, a South Asian organisation focusing on ending the oppression of marginalised groups, told MEE that Jani had to be fired immediately \"to send a message to the country that Hindu nationalists do not have a seat at the table of American democracy\".  Biden campaign urged to remove 'Modi supporter' as Muslim outreach coordinator Read More »  \"The campaign to fire Amit Jani is a piece of the puzzle, we need a public statement that Hindu nationalism and Islamophobia is not on the Biden agenda. We want policy platforms that actively take steps to address Hindu nationalist violence and Islamophobia.\"  Likewise, Lakshmi Sridaran, executive director of South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT), a national, nonpartisan, non-profit organisation, told MEE that Islamophobic rhetoric and policy, whether coming from Hindu nationalists or white supremacists, impacted all South Asian-Americans \"because they enable violence and justify discrimination against Muslims and those racialised as Muslim both in the United States and abroad\".  Sridaran also called on the Biden campaign to take a clear stance on the No Ban Act, the federal legislation which would rescind the now expanded Muslim Ban.  \"The Biden campaign must take a clear, public, and unequivocal position on the NO BAN Act and outline the substantive policy actions, not just cosmetic staffing changes they will take to confront Hindu nationalism, Islamophobia, and white supremacy going forward,\" Sridaran said.  Though Mitha has joined the Biden campaign as a senior aide, he has been long associated with and been a surrogate for Biden's bid for The White House.  Mitha held a campaign event for Biden in mid-February in which he reached out to Muslim Americans in Northern Virginia.  \"Community members had a substantive discussion with former US Senator Chris Dodd and campaign advisor Brian McKeon about issues that matter to the community from healthcare to the economy and immigration,\" Mitha said in a Facebook post.  Observers say that Biden's bid to engage Muslims, who number around one percent of the population, might be too late, especially in comparison to Senator Bernie Sanders' outreach efforts.  A number of American Muslim groups have endorsed Sanders, including Emgage, a Muslim political action committee where Mitha sits on the board.

Just like the coronavirus, racism has no borders. Across the world, angry people, representing a broad spectrum of society, marched this weekend as one to protest against racial injustices at home and abroad. | Martin Meissner / AP  Hundreds of thousands of people gathered this weekend in cities far from the United States to express anger over the death of George Floyd, a sign that the Black Lives Matter movement against police brutality is resonating with wider calls to address racism from Australia to Asia to Europe.  In Berlin, where police said 15,000 people rallied on the German capital’s Alexander Square, protesters chanted Floyd’s name and held up placards with slogans, such as “Stop police brutality” and “I can’t breathe.”  Floyd, a Black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck even after he pleaded for air while handcuffed and stopped moving.  “The killing and these violent physical things that have happened is only just the top of it,” said Lloyd Lawson, 54, who took part in the Berlin protest. “That’s why you’ve got to start right from the bottom, just like an iceberg.”  Some 20,000 people rallied in Munich, while thousands more took part in protests in Frankfurt and Cologne.  In Paris, several thousand demonstrators ignored a protest ban and assembled within sight of the U.S. Embassy, kept back by imposing barriers and riot police.  Among the crowd in the French capital was Marie Djedje, 14, a Parisian born on July 14, the French national day.  “I was born French, on the day when we celebrate our country. But on a daily basis, I don’t feel that this country accepts me,” she said, holding up a sign that read “Being Black is not a crime.”  The teenager said that emerging from France’s virus lockdown and seeing officers on patrol again drove home how scared she is of the police and how she has steeled herself for a life of overcoming obstacles.  “I know that because of my skin color, I’m starting out with a handicap, for example, if I want to get a flat or go to a top school,” she said. “I know I’m going to have to fight twice as hard as the others. But I’m prepared.”  In central London, tens of thousands staged a rally outside Parliament Square, invoking Floyd’s memory as well as people who died during police encounters or indifference in Britain. Some protesters ignored thickening rain clouds and later headed toward the U.K. Home Office, which oversees law enforcement and immigration, and to the U.S. Embassy.  Many dropped to one knee and raised their fists in the air outside the gleaming embassy building south of the River Thames. There were chants of “Silence is violence” and “Color is not a crime.”  “Everyone knows that this represents more than just George Floyd, more than just America, but racism all around the world,” said Darcy Bourne, a London-based student.  The majority of those marching wore masks and other face coverings and appeared to make an effort to adhere to social distancing guidelines by walking in small groups. Andrew Francis, 37, a Black man from London, said there’s “a lot of frustration due to racial discrimination, and we want change for our children and our children’s children to be able to have equality within the U.K, the U.S., all around the world.” Francis, who wore a face covering, said he wasn’t worried about the coronavirus and said the fight for racial equality was “more important” to him.  An estimated 15,000 people gathered in the heart of Manchester, England, while 2,000 people joined in a demonstration in the Welsh capital of Cardiff.  Protesters in the English port of Bristol vented their anger at the country’s colonial history by toppling a statue of a 17th-century slave trader. Demonstrators attached ropes to the statue of Edward Colston before pulling it down to cheers and roars of approval from the crowd.  It wasn’t the only statute targeted on Sunday. In Brussels, protesters clambered onto the statue of former King Leopold II and chanted “reparations,” according to video posted on social media. The word “shame” was also graffitied on the monument, reference perhaps to the fact that Leopold is said to have reigned over the mass death of 10 million Congolese.  Floyd’s death has sparked significant protests across the United States, but it has also struck a chord with minorities protesting discrimination elsewhere, including demonstrators in Sydney and Brisbane who highlighted Indigenous Australians who died in custody.  Indigenous Australians make up 2% of the country’s adult population, but 27% of the prison population. They are also the most disadvantaged ethnic minority in Australia and have higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poor health, as well as shorter life expectancies and lower levels of education and employment than other Australians.  In South Korea’s capital, Seoul, protesters gathered for a second straight day to denounce Floyd’s death. Wearing masks and black shirts, dozens of demonstrators marched through a commercial district amid a police escort, carrying signs such as “George Floyd Rest in Peace” and “Koreans for Black Lives Matter.”  In Senegal, people staged a protest in front of the African Renaissance Monument in the capital of Dakar, holding placards with slogans such as “Enough is enough.”  Chris Trabot, who works for Paris City Hall, said George Floyd’s death last week triggered his decision to demonstrate Saturday for the first time in his life.  Born in the French territory of Martinique, Trabot said he first experienced racism as a child when he moved with his family to mainland France and got in frequent fights with white kids who mocked his skin color. Recently, his 9-year-old daughter has told him of being a target of racism, too, with schoolmates mocking her hair.  Adele Letamba, a 39-year-old consultant protesting in Paris, put it bluntly: “The death of George Floyd was the spark that spread across the world.”  In Tel Aviv, thousands of protesters joined a Jewish-Arab rally against the Israeli government’s plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. The protesters wore masks, but social distancing measures were not strictly maintained as some demonstrators formed small groups. Police initially sought to block the rally, but later allowed it to take place.  Protesters in Israel also demonstrated against what they see as excessive violence by Israeli police against Palestinians. One protester held a poster showing George Floyd and Eyad Halak, a Palestinian with autism who was killed last week by Israeli police officers after apparently being mistaken as an attacker.  In Hong Kong, about 20 people staged a rally in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement on Sunday outside the U.S. Consulate in the Chinese city. “It’s a global issue,” said Quinland Anderson, a 28-year-old British citizen living in Hong Kong. “We have to remind ourselves despite all we see going on in the U.S. and in the other parts of the world, Black lives do indeed matter.”  Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets in downtown Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to protest against racism and police killings of black people on Sunday. The protesters weren’t just joining protests against Floyd’s death in the U.S., but also denouncing the killing of black people in Rio’s favelas.  The most recent case was João Pedro Pinto, 14, who was inside his house on May 18 in São Gonçalo, a city in Rio’s metropolitan area, when police chasing alleged drug traffickers shot into the house. The protesters on Sunday carried banners reading “Black mothers can’t stand crying anymore.” In São Paulo, another demonstration ended with clashes between a small group of protesters and the police.  A rally in Rome’s sprawling People’s Square was noisy but peaceful, with the majority of protesters wearing masks. Among those present was 26-year-old Ghanaian Abdul Nassir, who is studying for a master’s in business management at one of the Italian capital’s public universities.  “It’s quite unfortunate, you know, in this current 21st century that people of color are being treated as if they are lepers,” Nassir said. He said he occasionally has felt racist attitudes, most notably when riding the subway.  “Maybe you’re finding a place to stand, and people just keep moving (away) and you’ll be, like, ‘What?’” Nassir said: “We’re strong people but sometimes everyone has a limit.”  At one point, the protesters, most of them young and some with children or siblings, took the knee and raised a fist in solidarity with those fighting racism and police brutality.  In Italy’s financial capital, Milan, a few thousand protesters gathered in a square outside the central train station Sunday afternoon. Many in the crowd were migrants or children of migrants of African origin.  In Spain, several thousand protesters gathered on the streets of Barcelona and at the U.S. Embassy in Madrid. Many in Madrid carried homemade signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Human rights for all” and “Silence is pro-racist.”  “We are not only doing this for our brother George Floyd,” said Thimbo Samb, a spokesman for the group that organized the events in Spain mainly through social media. “Here in Europe, in Spain, where we live, we work, we sleep and pay taxes, we also suffer racism.”   ___  Associated Press journalists Rick Rycroft in Sydney; Dennis Passa and John Pye in Brisbane; Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea; Frank Jordans in Berlin; John Leicester in Paris; Pan Pylas in London; Shlomo Mor in Tel Aviv; Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo; Frances D’Emilio in Rome, Joseph Wilson in Barcelona, Spain; Katie Tam in Hong Kong; Frank Griffiths in London; Daniel Cole in Marseille, France; and Marcelo de Sousa in Rio de Janeiro contributed to this report.

The proclamation, which Trump first announced in a late-night tweet Monday, suspends immigration for people seeking green cards for 60 days.  The suspension applies to individuals who, as of Wednesday, are outside of the United States, do not have an immigrant visa and do not have official travel documents other than visas.  There are exceptions for permanent residents of the U.S., along with spouses and the children of U.S. citizens. The suspension also does not apply to individuals seeking to enter the country on an immigrant visa as a health care professional or medical researcher working to combat the coronavirus.  In a statement, Trump said he was asking the administration to review guest-worker programs to assess if more steps were needed to protect American workers.  When asked on Tuesday how the administration would decide on whether to extend the order past 60 days, Trump said he'll use the economy as a marker.  \"We'll see where we are with the economy, basically. And I think I'll have a very easy decision to make,\" Trump explained. \"I hope that the economy is going to be great by that time, but we'll see. But, right now, in light of the fact that Americans are out of jobs, I can't be taking in.\"  Trump suggested he could envision both rolling out an additional 30 days of the order as well as extending it by \"much more\" than 60 days.  The order is the broadest expansion of immigration restrictions imposed in the U.S. since the outbreak of the coronavirus. Earlier travel bans were targeted at slowing the spread of the pandemic.  You can read the full proclamation below.  \"Proclamation Suspending Entry of Immigrants Who Present Risk to the U.S. Labor Market During the Economic Recovery Following the COVID-19 Outbreak\"  The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has significantly disrupted the livelihoods of Americans. In Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak), I declared that the COVID–19 outbreak in the United States constituted a national emergency, beginning March 1, 2020. Since then, the American people have united behind a policy of mitigation strategies, including social distancing, to flatten the curve of infections and reduce the spread of SARS–CoV–2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This needed behavioral shift has taken a toll on the United States economy, with national unemployment claims reaching historic levels. In the days between the national emergency declaration and April 11, 2020, more than 22 million Americans have filed for unemployment.  In the administration of our Nation's immigration system, we must be mindful of the impact of foreign workers on the United States labor market, particularly in an environment of high domestic unemployment and depressed demand for labor. We must also conserve critical State Department resources so that consular officers may continue to provide services to United States citizens abroad. Even with their ranks diminished by staffing disruptions caused by the pandemic, consular officers continue to provide assistance to United States citizens, including through the ongoing evacuation of many Americans stranded overseas.  I have determined that, without intervention, the United States faces a potentially protracted economic recovery with persistently high unemployment if labor supply outpaces labor demand. Excess labor supply affects all workers and potential workers, but it is particularly harmful to workers at the margin between employment and unemployment, who are typically \"last in\" during an economic expansion and \"first out\" during an economic contraction. In recent years, these workers have been disproportionately represented by historically disadvantaged groups, including African Americans and other minorities, those without a college degree, and the disabled. These are the workers who, at the margin between employment and unemployment, are likely to bear the burden of excess labor supply disproportionately.  Furthermore, lawful permanent residents, once admitted, are granted \"open-market\" employment authorization documents, allowing them immediate eligibility to compete for almost any job, in any sector of the economy. There is no way to protect already disadvantaged and unemployed Americans from the threat of competition for scarce jobs from new lawful permanent residents by directing those new residents to particular economic sectors with a demonstrated need not met by the existing labor supply. Existing immigrant visa processing protections are inadequate for recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak. The vast majority of immigrant visa categories do not require employers to account for displacement of United States workers. While some employment-based visas contain a labor certification requirement, because visa issuance happens substantially after the certification is completed, the labor certification process cannot adequately capture the status of the labor market today. Moreover, introducing additional permanent residents when our healthcare resources are limited puts strain on the finite limits of our healthcare system at a time when we need to prioritize Americans and the existing immigrant population. In light of the above, I have determined that the entry, during the next 60 days, of certain aliens as immigrants would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.  NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would, except as provided for in section 2 of this proclamation, be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions. I therefore hereby proclaim the following:  Section 1. Suspension and Limitation on Entry. The entry into the United States of aliens as immigrants is hereby suspended and limited subject to section 2 of this proclamation.  Sec. 2. Scope of Suspension and Limitation on Entry.

(b) The suspension and limitation on entry pursuant to section 1 of this proclamation shall not apply to:  (i) any lawful permanent resident of the United States;  (ii) any alien seeking to enter the United States on an immigrant visa as a physician, nurse, or other healthcare professional; to perform medical research or other research intended to combat the spread of COVID-19; or to perform work essential to combating, recovering from, or otherwise alleviating the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, as determined by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their respective designees; and any spouse and unmarried children under 21 years old of any such alien who are accompanying or following to join the alien;  (iii) any alien applying for a visa to enter the United States pursuant to the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program;  (iv) any alien who is the spouse of a United States citizen;  (v) any alien who is under 21 years old and is the child of a United States citizen, or who is a prospective adoptee seeking to enter the United States pursuant to the IR-4 or IH-4 visa classifications;  (vi) any alien whose entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives, as determined by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their respective designees, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General or his designee;  (vii) any member of the United States Armed Forces and any spouse and children of a member of the United States Armed Forces;  (viii) any alien seeking to enter the United States pursuant to a Special Immigrant Visa in the SI or SQ classification, subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State may impose, and any spouse and children of any such individual; or  (ix) any alien whose entry would be in the national interest, as determined by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their respective designees.

(c) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, consistent with the laws of the United States.  Sec. 4. Termination. This proclamation shall expire 60 days from its effective date and may be continued as necessary. Whenever appropriate, but no later than 50 days from the effective date of this proclamation, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Labor, recommend whether I should continue or modify this proclamation.  Sec. 5. Effective Date. This proclamation is effective at 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time on April 23, 2020.  Sec. 6. Additional Measures. Within 30 days of the effective date of this proclamation, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall review nonimmigrant programs and shall recommend to me other measures appropriate to stimulate the United States economy and ensure the prioritization, hiring, and employment of United States workers.

(b) This proclamation shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.  (c) This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

He followed The Wire with Treme, his polyphonic portrait of post-Katrina New Orleans. Other projects have included the miniseries Generation Kill, following US Marines into Iraq; and The Deuce, about the seamy side of Seventies and Eighties Manhattan.  Now his latest work, The Plot Against America, arrives on Sky Atlantic, having aired to great acclaim in the US in March. It is a six-part adaptation of a Philip Roth novel of the same title, from 2004, in which the author told a powerful and, as it turned out, uncannily prescient story imagining what the effect would have been on his own family, and also the world, if, in the election year of 1940, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, rather than winning a third term and subsequently steering America into the war against fascism, had lost to the rabble-rousing anti-Semite, Charles Lindbergh, who almost certainly would not have done that.  Lindbergh was a huge figure in his time, greatly admired for his heroics as a pilot and recipient of much sympathy as a result of the kidnapping and killing of his infant son, in 1932, an incident HL Mencken described as “the biggest story since the Resurrection”. He was also a Nazi apologist and appeaser, and his dealings with the crypto-fascist America First movement and statements against US intervention in the war in Europe really did draw the contempt of President Roosevelt, who was on the record as “absolutely convinced” that “Lindbergh is a Nazi”.  This content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  Lindbergh didn’t, in reality, run on a populist Republican ticket against FDR for the Presidency. But if he had, who’s to say he wouldn’t have won, and that America would not have fallen under his power? That there would not have been pogroms in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia? That it would not have quickly become clear that beneath the surface of American society seething hatred was waiting for its excuse to burst forth, that what Roth called “the intoxication of anti-Semitism” was always there to be exploited?  Spotted any contemporary parallels yet? “Tonight,” says the victorious Lindbergh, “we have taken back America.” Any more obvious and he’d be wearing a MAGA hat.  The series boasts many fine performances. Winona Ryder is terrific as Philip’s Aunt Evelyn, a brittle woman so compromised by her romantic entanglement with the unctuous Lindbergh collaborator, Rabbi Lionel Bengelsdorf — John Turturro, laying on the Southern smarm — that she ends up dancing with Hitler’s foreign minister, von Ribbentrop, at the White House. Philip’s parents are played by Morgan Spector and Zoe Kazan, both excellent. The Northern Irish actor Anthony Boyle plays Philip’s brash, impetuous cousin, Alvin.  I spoke to Simon by Skype on a Thursday in late April. As he talked, sitting at his desk, morning sunshine poured through the Venetian blinds of his office. Like the rest of us, he was confined to barracks by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Obviously if I had anything ready to go to shoot, we wouldn’t be filming. Everything’s been shut down in terms of production.  Having had this massive over-supply, this super-abundance of TV in recent years, is there going to be a moment when it stops?  Yeah, there’s going to be a moment where the pipeline goes a little bit dry. I mean, you can do talk shows from your living room. But it’s hard to film drama.  John Turturro as Charles Lindbergh collaborator, Rabbi Lionel Bengelsdorf, in HBO’s The Plot Against America HBO  I’m going to talk to you about The Plot Against America. You were approached a few years ago to adapt Philip Roth’s novel for television, and you decided not to do it. Stupid question, but what changed?  A guy named Tom Rothman, who used to run, I think, Sony [actually Fox, he is now Chairman of Sony], he’s from Baltimore, he cold-called me and he said, ‘You should do Plot Against America, the Roth book.’ And I had read it back when it came out, years earlier, and I thought it was a really interesting dynamic but I felt it was sort of an artefact. It didn’t feel like where my country was going. This is 2013. We’d just elected an African-American president for the second time. We seemed to be becoming more inclusive, less susceptible to demagogue-ary. I said, ‘Look, really interesting book but I don’t know why anybody would film it now.’ And he said, ‘Well read it again, please, for me.’ And I did. I read it again and I thought, ‘Nah, it’s, it’s not the right time.’ So I didn’t think any more of it and then, three years later: Trump. So I’m sitting at lunch with the HBO guys and we’re all talking about what sort of television you can make in the age of Trump. And I had this book in my head. I said, ‘Whoever’s got the rights to Plot Against America, you should buy them up.’ I wasn’t talking about myself. I was saying, ‘The network should get somebody to do that.’ Anyway, they said, ‘That’s funny: Joe Roth just came in here. And he has the rights and he pitched. But The Man In The High Castle, The Handmaid’s Tale… there’s a lot of American dystopian stuff out there. We’re not sure we’re going to buy it.’ So when I got back to Baltimore from that lunch, I asked my assistant to call Joe Roth, and I said to him, because because I’m an idiot from Baltimore, I said, ‘Well, you tried to get me three years ago to do this and you were right and you were prescient, and I was wrong. But to make it up to you, I did try to put in a good word with HBO. You should call them back because I really tried to pitch this book.’ And I talked for about three minutes and finally he got a word in and he said, ‘Are you The Wire guy?’ And I went, ‘Yeah.’ And he said, ‘We’ve never talked before in my life. I’m just meeting you now, on this call.’ I said, ‘What, are you an idiot? We talked three years ago! You had the book.’ ‘I’ve only had the rights for a month.’ ‘Aren’t you the guy who used to run a studio?’ He says, ‘Yeah, I ran Warner Brothers [actually, Disney].’ I go, ‘Motherfucker, you called me three years ago with this book. How many other guys named Roth ran a studio…?’ So, eventually, in the middle of the call, he figures it out. He goes, ‘Are you talking about Tom Rothman?’ And I was like, ‘Um, too many Hebrews.’ I hung up the phone on him thinking, ‘He thinks I’m an idiot.’ Which I guess I was. And he called me back 10 minutes later and said, ‘Do you want to write it?’  When Tom Rothman originally suggested it to you, in 2013, what do you think it was about you specifically that made him approach you? I mean apart from the fact that you obviously have a track record of making great TV drama?  I think he was interested in having HBO make it. And I had an existing relationship with HBO so he thought of me. That was one thing. The other thing was, I’m Jewish. To do [Philip] Roth, I think you have to be Jewish-American or you at least have to be familiar with that milieu. It’s not like you can’t acquire it. You can. Nobody has to be something to write about it. I don’t have to be an Irish cop or a black guy from West Baltimore to write The Wire. But you have to do the work.   David Simon on-set HBO  What is it about the book that makes it a good candidate for a screen adaptation? Are there certain things that you’re looking for in a novel that you say, ‘Yes, this is the kind of thing that will make dramatic TV’?  Well it’s high-concept in terms of its imagining of a political landscape in America. It’s giving you a lot to work with in terms of its plotting. And that’s very rare for Roth. I mean I think Roth is one of the great pillars of modern American literature. But his bailiwick is the interior mind. He’s not heavy on plot. So this was a rare book in that sense, in that it had to be plot-heavy in terms of how this alternate America came to be. So, I had an advantage over a lot of people who’ve tried to adapt Roth. They’re trying to adapt books that basically rely heavily on the interior mind, and voice. And of course, narration in film is, by and large, death. I had the advantage of a book that was plot-heavy.  The word is in the title.  Right. On the other hand, he does a lot of stuff that he does elsewhere, which is the interior dialogue of young Philip Roth, the singular POV [point of view] of his 10-year-old self. That’s a pretty narrow point of view. So you look at the book right away, if you’re doing it as film, you look at it right away as: I have to expand the POV. It has to be everybody in the family. Six people.  \"I did not go in as a TV hack and say to Philip Roth, lion of American literature, ‘Hey, I have an idea.’\"  You met Roth and you talked to him about it. How involved was he?  It was just that one conversation. My experience with him was a one-and-a-half-hour conversation at his apartment about how to adapt the book. I can tell you the date of it because it was the day after they’d announced the Nobel. And he didn’t get it. It was you. It was the Brits. It was, Remains of the Day.   Ishiguro?  Ishiguro. And of course because I’m an asshole from Baltimore, I have to make a joke about it. As soon as he opens the door, he says, ‘How do you do?’ I say, ‘Who’s this Brit with your prize?’ And without missing a beat, he goes, ‘At least they didn’t give it to Peter, Paul and Mary.’ I don’t know if you get the reference but that was the folk trio from the Sixties. And the year before they’d given it to Bob Dylan.  Did he have any advice or requests or demands about the adaptation?  He had three or four things that he asked me to address, and I did. I agreed with most of them. I agreed with all of them actually. I either agreed or I was neutral. He wanted the family’s name changed from Roth to Levin. He felt that now that he wasn’t going to be writing the characterisation he wanted a little bit of distance from his real family. I think he asked for Weiss. And I just didn’t want to. There’s something about Weiss that just… I wanted something that was a little bit more definitive, like Roth, so I went with Levin.   What else?  He wanted us to know that the family should be secular or pretty close to secular. Nobody’s wearing payots, nobody’s orthodox, nobody’s going to shul. This is a Jewish community that’s assimilating to American so fast it makes your head spin. They’re already second generation. That’s mission-critical because it puts the lie to what Lindbergh and the Trumpists and everybody else who demonises immigration says. They’re always trying to pretend that the people coming in now, they’re not going to make good Americans, or they’re not going to make good Englishmen [in the case of the UK]. They’re not going to be right for us. It’s a great bugaboo that they use to consolidate and expand power. It’s a way of creating this othering of whatever vulnerable cohort, or whatever novel cohort there is, in the socio-political culture. So if [in the adaptation] you make it that these are Jews who are resisting assimilation in any way, you’re crediting [the idea] that they need to be made better Americans. I had absolutely no intention of doing that, but he was adamant, and he was right. And then I had one thing which I needed to bring up to him. I was looking for permission to play, basically to work on stuff. I told him that we were going to expand POV past Philip. And he saw that right away. He said, ‘Yeah, that’s the way to go.’ So that was quick. And then the last thing was, in the book the deus ex machina is [Lindbergh’s] plane disappears, and America snaps back to its historical self. He made that work about as well as you could in a novel. But it’s still a little convenient. And I thought, people who’ve watched six hours [of TV], they’re going to need more. I will confess I did not go in as a TV hack and say to Philip Roth, lion of American literature, ‘Hey, I have an idea.’ I’ve been accused of arrogance on many fronts. I did not have the kind of arrogance. I never will. Instead, I basically raised the problem that this was a little bit abrupt. And I sat there across from him, coffee table between us, opposing sofas, and he took me in over his reading glasses and then he read those pages two or three times – it felt like I was there for an hour and a half, it was probably like four minutes – but he was reading silently and after reading a couple, he closed the book and he looked at me and goes, ‘It’s your problem now.’   That’s perfect.  So I took that as permission to at least do something. And of course I left his apartment thinking, he seems to be really sharp. I mean he’s 80, 81. I didn’t know he was sick. So I thought, ‘I’m going to have to show him the scripts and then we’ll talk about it when I have something on paper.’ By the time I had scripts, he was gone. So I never got to. I don’t know if he would have approved or not. But he basically said, ‘Have at it.’  Philip Roth receiving the National Humanities Medal from Barack Obama in March 2011 Jim Watson Getty Images  Not that you would have ever wished it but as a writer, you’re liberated by that. He said that, and then he died.  I will confess to a moment of, ‘Well that’s a conversation I don’t have to have.’ And then immediately felt guilty. I was willing to have the nightmare conversation with him about changing the ending. And I mean, come on, it would have been a very cool thing to be walking the streets of those neighbourhoods with him, looking for locations. I would have dined out on those stories for years. But yeah, I did have a guilty writer’s moment of, ‘It’s mine. I get to run wild.’  David, we’re about half-way through this and I’m conscious that I’ve asked about three of my fifty questions.   Sorry. I’m… verbose.  \"When you metastasise intolerance, anti-Semitism always comes along. Once the white supremacists get all excited and hot and bothered, the Jew-hate comes along, no problem.\"  For those who have not read the book, The Plot Against America posits a scenario in which a celebrity demagogue, a fascist, a racist, becomes the president of the United States. When Roth published his novel, in 2004, that scenario seemed fanciful. Now it doesn’t. It’s happened. Does it mean that your TV show’s too late?  No. I think that’s a very funny thing to say. To use a word from the milieu of the book, I would say it’s kind of chutzpahdick [Yiddish for presumptuous] to say that this film is late when we’re looking at November 2020 as being one of the most fundamental dates of our history. I’m looking uphill at the most important election in my lifetime. A lot of effort was made at HBO and Blown Deadline [his production company] to get it on the air early on in the electoral cycle, so that it wasn’t devoured by daily headlines. Discussions were had about getting this on in the first quarter so that it can permeate, and so that people can find it over time. Because people tend to find this stuff when they stream it, not [when it’s first] broadcast.  Can you talk about why this will be the most important election of your lifetime?  Because the democratic norms of our republic that are essential to what America is, was and has to be are now up for grabs. We are no longer viably reliant on institutions and norms that ensure a republican form of government. These things are being challenged, these things are being brutalised, these things are being tossed aside. We’re finding out that a nation of laws only exists if you elect people who are committed to that premise and that, otherwise, laws are just things written in books. And we’ve been finding this out in painful ways for the last three years. And Roth imagined exactly such a moment in American history. [But] Roth imagined it with a hero [becoming president]. I mean, Lindbergh was one of the great heroes of that generation of Americans. My own father, at age seven, Jewish kid from Jersey City, crossed the river to New York with his father, my grandfather, to be on his shoulders to watch Lindbergh come down Broadway in a ticker tape parade. That was one of my dad’s earliest memories. And then 13 years later he’s at NYU as a journalism student and if you’re a Jewish-American kid, Lindbergh’s the devil. That’s an incredible pivot. But Lindbergh had the charisma of being genuinely heroic, genuinely a great aviator, a great American hero who had a cowlick, who was sheepishly self-effacing, who had a Midwesterner’s voice, the voice of the heartland, who everybody adored. They named a dance after him, the Lindy. Trump is a real estate magnate, failed casino operator and reality TV show host who never had a single moment of courage or heroism in his life.  And so the question is, why did he win? How did he do it?  Because he sold a significant plurality of Americans – not a majority but a significant plurality, in geopolitically meaningful states — he sold them the notion that they had been left behind. Which was true. The economic priorities of the last 20 or 30 years have marginalised much of the American working and middle classes. But he convinced them that the reason was because of people who aren’t like them: cosmopolitan, upper crust, Jewish. And because of grasping black and brown people who are reliant on a welfare state that actually serves more white people than not. And immigrants who are coming to take their jobs, and a whole range of others who they can hold in contempt and rage at. And he metastasised that latent American fear that’s been part of our country since the 1840s, since the Know-Nothings. I mean, it used to be directed at the Irish, then it was directed at the Italians and the Jews. All the while it’s been directed at African-Americans. Now it’s Latinos and Muslims, particularly. But it runs through American history. That train’s never late. Trump ran it right to the presidency.  Caleb Malis, Azhy Robertson, and Morgan Spector in The Plot Against America HBO  I think the quote from your show and from Roth’s book is, 'These arseholes' — or 'assholes', rather — 'they’ve always been here. Now they have permission to crawl out from under their rocks.'  I very much admire your attempt to make asshole an American word. Well played.   Thank you.  We were happy to write that line. You’ve watched it happen. I mean, the riot that you see [in a later episode of The Plot Against America], where the police stand by and let it happen, that’s [the equivalent of the 2017 Neo-Nazi rally in] Charlottesville.  If there is a plurality of people in America who are either racist themselves or comfortable with having a racist in the White House, these people seem to me unpersuadable in some sense. Is a TV drama going to make a difference? Does it not feel that you might be preaching to the converted with this show?  This is a political piece. And it’s fairly clear where I stand in terms of my country’s future. You win elections in my country not by trying to convince the other guy’s base to vote for you. You win elections by getting your base to the polls. Hence where we ended this mini-series.  I wanted to come to the ending in a minute. Before that, there’s a figure in the book and in your show, the columnist Walter Winchell, who is the most outspoken critic of Lindbergh and the figure around whom all the other people who oppose him can rally. Do you see a similar figure in America today? Is it Joe Biden?  No. But he’ll have to do. Let me say this: I think Joe Biden has been a generally good man living in a generally ineffectual political model, and doing not as much good as he needs to. That would be my critique of Joe Biden. And he absolutely has my vote.  How optimistic are you about his chances?  I’m not pessimistic, but I think it’s going to be a fight and he better bring it and the Democrats better deliver. What can I tell you? I’m 59. I’ve never voted in an American general election for a candidate that I completely agree with. Hasn’t happened yet. Don’t expect it to happen before I die. I’m on the left of the Democratic party on three-quarters of the issues you could imagine. I’m probably to the left of every single general election nominee the Democrats have ever offered. And still, every vote mattered. [The] 2016 [election] is a defining example of the first rule of politics, which is: it can always get worse.  You made a significant change to the end of Roth’s book. In Roth’s book, Lindbergh’s plane goes missing and then FDR returns to the presidency and things in America proceed pretty much as we know they did. Your ending is more ambivalent. We don’t know what’s going to happen, we just know there’s going to be an election and we also know there’s going to be chicanery in that election.  We abbreviate the story. We didn’t want to give away what happens in the election, we go out at the moment you start hearing the first election results.  But the viewer also knows that some of the ballot papers have been interfered with, that the election is corrupt. At same time we listen to Frank Sinatra singing “The House I Live In”. The famous line from that song is, ‘What is America to me?’ It seems to me a profoundly pessimistic statement about the potential for American democracy to function as it should.  I think we’ve experienced a commitment on the part of some of our political spectrum to undermining the very premise of electoral integrity. The absolute commitment to voter suppression, to throwing people off the voting rolls. The, as you call it, chicanery with ballots has become so pronounced with every election cycle. Not to mention the disinformation campaigns that are now sponsored by external players. You’ve seen that in the UK. We’ve seen it everywhere, all across Europe. The fact that our electoral systems are no longer sacrosanct, maybe they never were, but technology has now raised its head in terms of disinformation, the internet, computerised balloting and computerised voting rules. We’ve now reached a point where I’m not really sure Americans can trust the result. And I say that with a great deal of terror. It’s not the cynicism of somebody who’s going to use it to throw up his hands and not vote or not get out the vote. I’m here. There’s no choice. It’s dystopian, maybe, but there’s no choice. I am very pessimistic about our commitment to wholly free and fair elections in my own country. And that said, election day’s still election day. There’s nothing to do but have the fight.  David Simon speaks at the 69th Writers Guild Awards New York in 2017 Dimitrios Kambouris Getty Images  You’ve already touched on this but both the book and the show are concerned with what it means to be an American, what it means to be a Jew, and what it means to be a Jewish-American. I wonder if that conflict is resolved in your mind?  It was resolved in Roth’s mind and it’s resolved in my mind. I’m an American. The hyphenate doesn’t make me any less American. It doesn’t make anybody who’s a Muslim-American or a Mexican-American or a Brazilian-American or a Chinese-American, less American. The hyphenate is the least important thing in the structure of our country. And we’ve proven it for the entire history of the nation. And yet we can’t get past the notion that there might be some people who might be less American than we would desire, that the language they’re speaking or the god they’re worshipping or the politics they’re following or the smells of the food coming down the hall from their apartment, are just not quite American enough. And if they get hold of political agency, well, a true American’s going to suffer! And the incredible thing, what is shocking to me, is to see even certain Jewish-Americans or Irish-Americans or Italian-Americans who are willing to embrace this vernacular when it comes to people of colour. Like, did you understand that you weren’t white, at one point? You were Irish, and you were absolutely not white. The signs in New York told you you were not white. I have, on my website, a picture of 11 of the 12 people in my family who were killed in the Holocaust. I know their names, I have their photographs. I’m missing one photograph, of a small child. And they couldn’t get out. So they’re dead at Auschwitz, they’re dead in the woods in Belarus. And America had quotas. And from 1924 on, we just had too many Jews and too many of them were Bolsheviks and their politics weren’t right, they weren’t going to make good Americans, and they were crowded into the Lower East Side, we got to stop this, the country is getting to be less American! Fast forward to Syria. And the numbers of sons of bitches – some of them Jewish, some of them Irish, some of them Italian – who all of a sudden think, ‘Oh my god, we can’t possibly house a Syrian child!’ The governor of my state [Maryland], Larry Hogan: We’re not taking any Syrians. They could be terrorists. The mortifying shame of it, if you’re a human being. But Trump is really going after people of colour, black and brown. He’s going after Muslims, he’s going after Mexicans and Mexican-Americans. He’s been explicit about who he’s othering. And he’s not done the Jews. Doesn’t matter. Because when you metastasise intolerance, anti-Semitism always comes along. Once the white supremacists get all excited and hot and bothered, the Jew-hate comes along, no problem.  In the States, The Plot Against America recently finished its run on HBO. I read the reviews, they were extremely admiring. Did people react as you’d hoped they would?  Listen, it always feels like you got away with it. When you’re in the middle of it, it’s like, ‘Jeez, I hope we didn’t fuck this up.’ Especially when we changed stuff. You’re waiting to see if people rebel, because people do love the book, and there’s things we couldn’t fit. So you worry, ‘Have we done justice to the book?’ I think we did OK. But film for me is always a journey of given resources: I have this much money, I have this much time, here’s my air date, where can I put the money on screen best to make you believe the narrative? I think we did that really well. I’m very proud of us. We shot with the money we had, the time we had, and it tells the story.  I want to ask you a broader question about TV. You are one of the key figures in the golden age that people talk about now, of so-called prestige TV, that decade or so from around 2000, when…  Wait! The golden age involves Jackie Gleason and Bert and Ernie. That’s the golden age.  The second golden age, shall we say? I know you didn’t come up with the title.   The brass age.  Ok, we’ll call it the brass age. So you were a key player in the brass age of prestige television, and that paved the way for the current situation, where we have an enormous amount of new shows streaming all of the time, literally hundreds. No person, even the most committed couch potato could possibly watch all of that stuff. And there’s a sense that some of it’s quite mediocre, not as good as it was, or it should be. I certainly feel that. Do you?  I think people should read more books. They should, I’m just saying. Television seems to have taken some part of the quadrant that used to be occupied by literature. Some of [TV] is literature, at least has the heft of literature, and some of it just is still TV. The truth is, I think probably the amount of quality TV and the amount of shit TV is in the same exact proportion as before this “Golden Age.” I think we have more good TV and we have more shit. And you’re responsible for sifting more. Every time I stumble into a show that I’m just astonished that someone underwrote it, then I find out it’s a hit! So what do I know? What do I fucking know? I’ve never had an audience contemporaneous to broadcast in my life.  Wendell Pierce and Dominic West in The Wire HBO  That’s one of the strange things about your shows, right? Mostly they’re slow burns that have to wait to find their audiences.  Yeah. Now people are calling me and going, ‘Oh my god, I just watched Treme and I’m moving to New Orleans!’ At the time I couldn’t sell Treme because it was post-Wire. Instead of guns I had trombones. People were like, ‘What is this? This is not The Wire!’  Do you think that the glut of TV both good and bad makes it harder for the really good stuff to break through?  Listen, when there wasn’t a glut, I had The Wire and I couldn’t break through. But in some ways, yes. I think if we saw Netflix’s viewing numbers, even the stuff that Netflix has that I think is quite good, I think we’d see that nothing’s dominant, everything’s getting a little bit of a slow burn. There’s one or two shows at any given moment that are water-cooler. Game of Thrones, in its moment. But I’m not sure that anyone’s pulling any of those Sopranos or Sex and the City numbers. The viewing dynamic is now so fractured. When Plot aired here, we had people quarantined from coronavirus at home. I thought, ‘Motherfucker, I’m actually going to get an audience because nobody has anything else to do.’ You know, like, ‘Watch my slow, dry shit. Watch this! I know we’re going to pull a million people.’ We ended up pulling under 500,000. Like, ‘Oh boy, OK.’ I sort of laughed about it with [HBO president] Casey Bloys: ‘My usual little number.’ But now we’re over three-and-a-half million for the first episode. TV is now a lending library. You get to it when you get to it. And that means two things. It means a guy like me can have a sinecure for 20 years at HBO, which is nice. But it also means there’s really quality stuff that not everybody runs to the water cooler the next morning and talks about.  \"You cannot understand the origins of totalitarianism as well from watching The Plot Against America or The Handmaid’s Tale as you can by reading Hannah Arendt\"  TV has become the dominant form. It’s so much bigger than cinema, or novels, or theatre, to the extent that those forms have been totally eclipsed. Why?  Nothing has the reach that television does. Television is film in your home. What happened is, before we got rid of the advertisers, television was a juvenile medium. Every 13 minutes you had to stop to appease the advertisers. And you had to keep people in a good, happy frame of mind so that they kept coming back after every commercial break, and they kept coming back in a mood to consume, to buy iPods and blue jeans. That meant you could only have a certain type of programme, and it was a juvenile one. When cable got rid of the advertisers, suddenly it’s effectively film, except you can do long-form, which starts to approximate the novel. To the extent that I had any place to stand that was unique, I came from the world of writing books. I’d written a couple of books, and I’d written long-form journalism. And so it interested me, the idea of doing one story over a season of episodes rather than the episodic nature of television drama up to that point. That said, there are things books can do that film cannot. In terms of the interior mind, in terms of the narrator, in terms of tone and theme and ideas, there are things that can be conveyed by prose that are powerful and that make your mind think in ways that film cannot. And there are things film can do that books cannot.  What can film do that books can’t do?  With editing, you can create moods and emotions that might elude you if you read the same thing on the page. Sometimes it’s something as simple as the shot composition. Look at me, I’m talking like I went to film school! But people by and large aren’t reading as much as they once did, and I think that’s bad. You cannot understand the origins of totalitarianism as well from watching The Plot Against America or The Handmaid’s Tale as you can by reading Hannah Arendt. I’m sorry. If you read [The Origins of Totalitarianism] you’re going to know more than if you watch our TV show. You might want to read the book. Just saying.  The Origins of Totalitarianism Penguin Classics amazon.co.uk £8.19 SHOP NOW  For many years you were a reporter for The Baltimore Sun. Covid-19 is yet another nail in the coffin for newspapers. Do you mourn their passing? Do you think it matters?  I don’t care about newsprint. I don’t care about cutting down trees and throwing them on people’s doorsteps. I think the faster that newspapers transition to a digital model and the faster they get the receiving devices for that digital model into the homes of every American, the better off journalism will be. But they have to create a revenue stream for the digital model. The failure to do that was an astonishing incompetence on the part of newspaper publishers and of the industry, and of Wall Street. It was the triumph of short-term profit over long-term plan. In my country, I feel like journalism actually got a second leg from Trump. I think journalists were by and large astounded at the efficacy of wholesale lying, the death of the truth as a premise for this administration, when lies are so evolved and so definitive and so constant. But in the wake of Trump, the papers that have taken on the task – The New York Times, The Washington Post – have found their purpose again. Pick up the paper, there’s an assessment of which lies got told the day before. Is everybody reading it? No, but it’s creating a definitive, alternative version. Journalism still has its existential crisis. It’s terrifying. If you’re not The New York Times or The Washington Post, or The LA Times or The Wall Street Journal, you really got to worry. But thank god for journalism finding its purpose again. Were you around 10 years ago where all these new maven professors at whatever university of media were saying, ‘You don’t need journalists anymore, we have citizens’ voices?’   I was, yeah.  You fucking morons. Now everyone’s a journalist and no one can tell truth from shit. You fucking morons! You know, I listened to this shit and I said, ‘Really?’ Some of the best moments in journalism I was involved with, involved standing round with an editor and just deciding not to run a story because it wasn’t what we originally thought it was or because questions hadn’t been answered or because there was an alternative explanation to what we thought was a scandal and we needed to go get more reporting. Nothing exists like that in the internet. The moment somebody has an idea or a thought in their head, it’s publishable.   Correct.  Which is why, on Wikipedia for about five or six years, I was married to Howard Stern’s ex-wife. I didn’t correct it. I didn’t give a shit. Somebody else had the name David Simon, and I had the name David Simon, and why bother checking it out? Let’s just put it up on the internet and then we’ll watch it get repeated all around the world.  \"Don’t mistake Twitter for a place that is anything other than a bathroom wall.

You’ll see me be more involved in it when I’m in production, when I’m trapped on a film set and I’m sitting in a chair by the monitors, and it’s taking them 40 minutes to move a light, and I got nothing else to do. Actually, when I come off of filming, I get much less active, so.  Does it scratch an itch that doesn’t get scratched in some other way?  To me it’s performance art of a kind. I’m just being a provocateur. I hope people are in on the joke. It’s a platform and I use it when I have something to promote, like Plot Against America. Now I have 250,000 people that I can tell, ‘Hey this is on, on Monday night.’ So it actually serves a function in terms of what I do for a living. That’s the purpose of it. And the other part is, to get to 250,000 followers, you have to poke somebody in the eye. If I have a reasoned conversation with somebody about an issue, I’ll look up at the end of the day and I’ll have gained eight Twitter followers. If I call somebody a fucking mook and tell him he’s an idiot and insult his mother, and do it in some way that has a little bit of a humorous cadence, I’ll look up at the end of the day and I’ll have 600 new followers. That’s what Twitter is. Don’t mistake it for a place that is anything other than a bathroom wall. It’s a bathroom partition and there’s a pen attached to a string.  You’re good at the bathroom wall insults. I think ‘fucknuts’ is favourite of mine.   I’m from Baltimore.  The fact that you live in Baltimore still, rather than Beverly Hills or Brooklyn or wherever fancy entertainment industry people live, that seems fundamental to your identity, your self-image.  The truth is, I’m not even native to Baltimore. I grew up right over the district line, in Maryland. So I was oriented as a Washingtonian and I came here after college, to be a reporter. But I definitely don’t associate with the industry that gives me my work. Listen, I have a place in New York, I do all my editing in New York, New York’s a wonderful city, maybe the greatest American city. But when America gets cancer, it doesn’t start on the streets of Manhattan, it doesn’t start in West LA, it doesn’t start in Washington. When stuff starts showing up, and you start seeing the cracks in what we’ve tried to build as a nation, they show up in places like Baltimore. They show up in second-tier, post-industrial cities. New York has been rebuilt completely by Wall Street money. The only thing that can mug you in Alphabet City right now is a two-star restaurant. Washington is an economic artifice because of the government being there. West LA is recession-proof because of the entertainment industry. But Baltimore, you feel the country. And not just Baltimore, many places like it. I think that it’s helped [me] see things going awry. In some ways, if you’re a writer in New York and you’re trying to assess the state of the nation, there’s a certain gauze on you. St Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, that second tier, that’s where you feel the disconnect.  Winona Ryder in The Plot Against America HBO  Does this bring us back to Newark, New Jersey? Is that why Roth was able somehow to see what was going to happen in America: he was from a working class family in Newark, not from Manhattan or Santa Monica?  Maybe. He certainly was able to acquire his own sense of his vulnerability in 1940, when most of the country was isolationist, when the German-American Bund was able to fill Madison Square Garden. If you were Jewish at that time, you felt like a vulnerable cohort, in a way that you don’t feel today if you’re Jewish. Or you shouldn’t. But you should feel that way if your immigration status is vulnerable. If you’re a first generation Mexican-American and you’re struggling with your English then you’re going to be abused. If you’re a Somalian in Minnesota you’re going to be pilloried because you happen to worship a different god, and all you’re trying to do is make a better life for your family. Those are the vulnerable people who have been used as fuel by this son-of-a-bitch, vile demagogue, who is as unfit to be president as Charles Lindbergh would have been.  That’s an excellent way to end, David. Thank you.   Thank you. Be well.  The Plot Against America is on Sky Atlantic from 14 July  Like this article?

When adjusted for inflation, that’s over 50% higher than 2016 election spending. This year’s federal election spending – for the presidency, the Senate and the House of Representatives – is on track to be double what it was in 2008.  The surge in campaign spending is striking. But my research on campaign finance regulation suggests the volume of election spending is not the main problem with the U.S. campaign finance system.  The real challenge for American democracy is where this money comes from.   No public campaign funding  American federal election campaigns are entirely funded by private money; most of it is provided by wealthy individual donors, political action committees and other interested organizations. Wealthy candidates also fund their own campaigns.  The U.S. has a public funding program for presidential elections, established in 1974. For two decades it played an important role in campaigns.  But it provided candidates with limited funds and imposed very low spending limits. As the needs and costs of contemporary campaigns grew, the system collapsed. While still available, no major candidate has taken public funds in the last three presidential elections.  When Joe Biden ran for the Democratic nomination in 1988, and again in 2008, he qualified for and accepted public funds, which accounted for 22% and 14%, respectively, of his campaign funds.  This year, as of Aug. 31, 2020, all of the $531 million funding Joe Biden’s campaign so far came from private funds, according to Open Secrets, a publicly available database that tracks campaign finance data. So did the $476 million funding President Donald Trump’s reelection bid so far.  The one-thousandth of the 1%  The private dollars that fuel U.S. elections come mostly from a tiny fraction of society. Critics of American inequality often talk about “the 1%” – but in campaign finance it is the 0.0001% who matter.  Federal law requires political campaigns, parties, PACs and outside groups to report the identities of donors who give at least $200.  The September campaign finance filings – which cover contributions through the end of August – indicate that just 2.8 million people, or 0.86% of the U.S. population, had contributed $200 or more to this year’s federal elections. Yet collectively, these relatively high spenders had supplied almost 74% of all campaign funds.  That’s almost $5 billion given by a small fraction of Americans. An even smaller number – 44,000 people, or about one-hundredth of 1% of the United States’ 328 million people – have so far given $10,000 or more each to this election, adding up to nearly $2.3 billion. And 2,635 people or couples – less than one-thousandth of the U.S. population – together provided $1.4 billion, roughly one-fifth of total campaign contributions reported as of late summer.  These numbers reflect only publicly reported contributions. The rise of “dark money groups” – which spend to influence election outcomes but do not have to disclose their donors because they claim to be primarily nonelectoral – suggests even more campaign money is provided by a few elite donors.  [Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter.]   The donor class  America’s donor class is not representative of the broader community whose interests are at stake in an election.  Donors are older, whiter and wealthier than America as a whole, my analysis shows, and they hail disproportionately from certain places. So far this year, more money has come from Washington, D.C., than from 20 states combined, and Joe Biden raised 10% of his money from just six zip codes – areas in Washington, D.C., New York City, a New York suburb and a suburb of Indianapolis.  Certain industries, like finance, real estate, communications, law, health care, natural resources, oil and gas, are also particularly big election spenders via both personal and PAC donations related to the industries. There is no formal tracking of these donors.  According to media reports and websites like Open Secrets, recent years have seen a striking increase in the number and importance of small donors. This year, small donors account for about 22% of campaign fundraising, up from 14% in 2016.  That’s a step in a more democratic direction. But big donors are still pivotal to America’s campaign finance system.   Impact on democracy  Whoever wins in 2020 will be tasked with addressing the pandemic’s devastating economic and public health harms. A host of other enormously consequential issues – from racial justice and immigration to trade, the environment and the courts – also hinge on the election outcome.  Having a small number of very wealthy individuals financing political candidates distorts the political process. This is less a classical quid pro quo – the exchange of campaign dollars for votes – than it is politicians’ reluctance to take positions that are at odds with the interests of their large donors. What gets on – or stays off – the legislative agenda can be driven by donor concerns.  Donor influence tends to be more significant for issues that get little media attention – who gets a specific tax break, for example, or qualifies for coronavirus relief – than for hot-button concerns like reproductive rights. But campaign money inevitably shapes government action and who benefits from it, who is harmed and who is ignored.  As the Supreme Court explained in sustaining the 2002 McCain-Feingold Act’s ban on “soft money” – donations that can affect an election without being expressly focused on the election – “The evidence connects soft money to manipulations of the legislative calendar, leading to Congress’s failure to enact, among other things, generic drug legislation, tort reform and tobacco legislation.”  In 2018, then-federal budget director and former congressman Mick Mulvaney admitted as much with disarming candor: “We had a hierarchy in my office in Congress. If you’re a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn’t talk to you. If you’re a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.”  As the saying goes, he who pays the piper calls the tune.

Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government would bring in new laws so it could “stop those who come here illegally making endless legal claims to remain” and “expedite the removal of those who have no claim for protection.”  Patel said in a speech to a virtual Conservative Party conference that the changes would be “the biggest overhaul of our asylum system in decades.”  She said Britain would continue to “provide safe haven to those fleeing persecution, oppression or tyranny.”  Patel’s hardline rhetoric was designed to appeal to voters concerned at a surge in the number of people crossing the English Channel from France in small boats. Thousands have made the journey this year, most over the summer.  Opposition Labour Party immigration spokesman Nick Thomas-Symonds said the Conservatives were “devoid of compassion and competence” on immigration.  Migrants have long used northern France as a launching point to reach Britain by stowing away in trucks or on ferries. Many appear to have turned to small boats organized by smugglers during the coronavirus pandemic because virus restrictions have reduced vehicle traffic between France and Britain.  Patel’s speech follows reports in recent weeks that the government considered ideas including building a wave machine in the Channel to deter boats and processing asylum-seekers on Ascension Island, a remote volcanic island more than 4,000 miles (6,435 kilometers) from the U.K.  The government dismissed some of the more far-fetched claims, but Patel said she would “explore all practical measures and options to deter illegal migration.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 4, "positive": 7, "negative": 4, "disgust": 1, "joy": 1, "anger": 5, "surprise": 1, "fear": 8, "trust": 3}, "metadata": ["minister", "asylum", "conservative", "overhaul", "fleeing", "rhetoric", "surge", "immigration", "spokesman", "migrants", "northern", "coronavirus", "pandemic", "virus", "asylum-seekers", "options", "illegal"]}, {"text": "Washington D.C. [USA], Aug 22 (ANI): The Trump administration on Wednesday unveiled new rules that would allow officials to indefinitely detain migrant families crossing the border illegally. This would replace the decades-old agreement that limited the time of authorities who could hold migrant children in custody.  The White House has for more than a year pressed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to find a way to eliminate the agreement, known as the Flores settlement, a shift that immigration authorities say is crucial to halt the flow of migrants across the southwestern border, The New York Times reported.  Families typically have to wait several months for their cases to work their way through immigration court, and the new rule would allow DHS to keep those families at detention facilities.  The settlement had placed limits on how long children could be held in detention, leading the administration to release tens of thousands of families pending the resolution of their cases.  Quoting Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, Kevin McAleenan, Al Jazeera reported that those releases, under the new rule, were an incentive for immigrants to travel with children and that the government believes the new detention rule will have a deterrent effect.  McAleenan said the government believes some families apprehended on the border were \"fraudulent\" based on DNA testing of some migrants in pilot programmes implemented in recent months.  The rule will be published in the Federal Register on Friday and will take effect 60 days from that publication.  However, immigration rights advocates have denounced the new regulation and said prolonged detention would traumatise immigrant children.

Instead, ahead of this week's GOP convention, the committee unanimously approved a resolution stating that the party \"will continue to enthusiastically support the President's America-first agenda.\"  Ferrier comes from the establishment wing of the Republican Party. She worked as a communications adviser to current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and earlier for former House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio. She says the fact that the party is evolving is hardly unusual. All political parties change over time, she says, depending on issues and circumstances.  But there is something different this time, says conservative Ramesh Ponnuru of the American Enterprise Institute. It's that Trump's takeover comes absent any deeply held ideology.  \"It's not like [1964 GOP presidential nominee Barry] Goldwater with Goldwater-ism or [President Ronald] Reagan with Reagan-ism,\" Ponnuru said. \"There just really isn't a Trump-ism that transcends his whims of the moment.\"   Support comes from  A change on trade and taking Putin's word  A lot of long-held Republican beliefs — once seen as party dogma — have been jettisoned under Trump.  The party of free trade has backed Trump as he imposes tariffs and criticizes trade deals. Most notable is his withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact negotiated by the Obama administration and designed to be a counterweight to China's growing economic power.  On national defense, the president accuses NATO allies of not carrying their weight and essentially freeloading off the United States.  Then there's the longtime GOP hard line regarding the Soviet Union and Russia.  Think back to 1987 and one of the defining moments of Reagan's presidency. Standing near the Berlin Wall and the famed Brandenburg Gate, Reagan sent a message to the leader of the Soviet Union: \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\"  Reagan has another famous line he used when describing his dealings with the Soviets: \"Trust but verify.\"  Trump's interactions with his Russian counterpart, President Vladimir Putin, seem consistently conciliatory, especially when compared to Reagan.  Trump and Putin met in Helsinki in 2018, not long after U.S. intelligence agencies had concluded that Russia had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. Asked at a news conference whether he'd confronted Putin about the revelation, Trump answered, \"I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.\"  Hard line on immigration well received by GOP voters  A key issue for Trump during the campaign and as president has been his hard line on immigration. Again, his stance is a far cry from recent Republican presidents.  Reagan signed an immigration reform law that allowed for amnesty for immigrants who entered the country illegally before 1982. President George W. Bush also pushed for immigration reform and highlighted the humanity of those crossing the border illegally, saying they do it to provide for their families.  \"When I was governor of Texas I liked to say family values do not stop at the Rio Grande River,\" Bush said in a speech near the border with Mexico.  You'll hear no such comments from Trump, who has largely kept up the tone of the rhetoric he used in his very first speech as a presidential candidate.  \"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists,\" he said that day in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City.  The president tapped into existing anti-immigrant sentiment in the Republican Party. Same with his attacks on global trade deals. Many working-class voters felt they suddenly had a champion in Trump.  Tom Zawistowski, a Tea Party leader in Northeast Ohio, says it was like they'd found someone who'd been listening to what his movement had been talking about for years.  \"This whole idea of, what about our jobs?\" Zawistowski said of Trump. \"He talked about the 'forgotten man' in 2016. You know, he talked about manufacturing jobs when the elites in both parties were basically saying, 'Hey, if you like to do manufacturing, tough luck.' \"  While some may not like his Twitter habit, polls show sky-high approval for Trump among Republicans. Social conservatives praise Trump's judicial appointments. Others celebrate the 2017 tax-cut package. And many cheer his attacks on the media.  Such solid GOP support comes even amid the pandemic, the more than 175,000 U.S. deaths it has caused so far, and the dive the economy and employment took as well.   Enter the \"Never Trumpers\"  Then there are those Republicans who have not been able to abide the president's decisive takeover of their party. Many simply call themselves \"Never Trumpers.\"  Stuart Stevens, a former top presidential campaign strategist to GOP nominees George W. Bush and Mitt Romney, is one of them. Now he's working to defeat Trump by joining a group known as The Lincoln Project, which frequently produces viral ads attacking Trump.  Stevens doesn't hesitate to call Trump racist, and in an interview on Fresh Air earlier this month, he said the current campaign reflects that. Looking ahead to the final months before Election Day, he said of the president: \"It's going to be a racial grievance campaign unlike we have ever seen on the national stage.\"  As for the Republican Party, Stevens said he's \"extraordinarily negative on the prospects of the party.\" Democrats overwhelmingly win the votes of African American and Latino voters, and now younger voters. Stevens says with the country becoming more diverse demographically, that's a crisis for the GOP.  \"And what does that mean for the Republican Party?\" he asked. \"It's a stage 4 cancer warning and the party gives no reason that it's going to change.\"  Instead, Stevens said, Trump is actively driving those voters away.  It's his party — will it last?  As for how lasting Trump's transformation of the GOP will be, that depends on the election.  If he wins, the story continues. But if he loses, says AEI's Ponnuru, there'll be a push to move on to someone else. He cites recent incumbent presidents defeated after one term — Jimmy Carter and the first George Bush — as two whose influence on their party faded instantly.  But Trump, he said, may be a different case. First off, if he loses, he'll likely say the election was \"rigged.\" Further, he's not likely to exit the political arena as others have. Trump will likely still be on cable TV and certainly on Twitter, Ponnuru said. \"That's going to be a very delicate problem of coalition management and expansion for any future Republican Party.\"  GOP strategist Ferrier put it this way: \"If there are those who believe that the Republican Party is just going to snap back to some status quo ante of, say, the Bush administration, I think that is misguided.\"  Meanwhile, this week's GOP convention is giving America a nightly view of the current Republican Party, under complete command of President Trump.

That's his specialty, he's the uterus collector. I know that's ugly... Is he collecting these things or something?... Everybody he sees, he's taking all their uteruses out or he’s taken their tubes out.\"  According to the report, which cites detainees who came forward to Project South but remain unnamed:  A detained immigrant told Project South that she talked to five different women detained at ICDC between October and December 2019 who had a hysterectomy done. When she talked to them about the surgery, the women 'reacted confused when explaining why they had one done.' The woman told Project South that it was as though the women were 'trying to tell themselves it's going to be OK.' She further said: 'When I met all these women who had had surgeries, I thought this was like an experimental concentration camp. It was like they're experimenting with our bodies.'  \"Forced sterilization is a deliberate, systemic, and targeted devaluation of Black, Brown, and Indigenous women, people, and families,\" IF/When/How, a reproductive justice organization, tweeted in a thread about the complaint Monday. \"It is a part of America's history as a country, and it is clearly very much a part of our present.\"  Journalist Thom Hartmann suggested known racist Stephen Miller, a senior policy advisor to President Donald Trump, might have been involved, tweeting, \"We used to call this eugenics in America—the purposeful, medical elimination of the ability of 'undesirable people' to reproduce. We did it to Blacks and Native Americans by the tens of thousands in the 1920s. Stephen Miller's fingerprints must be all over this.\"  The bulk of Monday's complaint focused on violations related to Covid-19 at the detention facility. According to a statement from the Government Accountability Project:  Ms. Wooten's disclosures about gross mismanagement include: Deliberately denying or delaying medical care for detained immigrants both before and during the coronavirus pandemic, including immigrants symptomatic for Covid-19  Refusing to test symptomatic detained immigrants for Covid-19  Failing to use two rapid-response Covid-19 testing machines  Prescribing over-the-counter cold medications to detained immigrants with Covid-19 symptoms instead of proper treatment  Failing to isolate detained immigrants who had confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19  Failing to quarantine detained immigrants who had close contact with confirmed Covid-19 cases  Failing to maintain hygiene and sanitation standards for medical exam rooms and equipment, which includes often leaving blood on the floor  Failing to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to medical and correctional staff who have close and prolonged contact with detained immigrants with confirmed cases of Covid-19  Failing to enforce or encourage CDC social-distancing practices among detained immigrants and staff  Reprimanding staff who encouraged others to follow CDC's mandatory social-distancing practices  Requiring symptomatic staff to continue to work in the facility and threatening staff with discipline if they refuse to work in dangerous conditions  Violating CDC rules concerning the transfer of immigrants with confirmed cases of Covid-19  Systematically undercounting and underreporting Covid-19 cases at ICDC.

This year’s count has been beset by problems caused by the pandemic, including a delayed timeline and a higher than usual attrition rate among temporary employees hired to complete the count and track down households that don’t self-respond to the survey, including many minorities, immigrants and other ­hard-to-count groups.   AD  “Today’s ruling is a necessary and encouraging first step toward saving the 2020 Census from a massive undercount that will disproportionately affect our country’s communities of color,” said Thomas Wolf, senior counsel and Spitzer Fellow with the Brennan Center’s Democracy Program, which is representing the plaintiffs, which include the National Urban League, the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, the League of Women Voters and jurisdictions in Texas, Washington state and California.   AD  “Today’s ruling buys the census some precious and indispensable time by barring the administration from shutting down the count while the federal courts are still considering our request for relief,” Wolf said.  The Census Bureau did not respond to questions about how much of the winding-down plan it has implemented since the government’s Aug. 3 announcement that it was moving up the end of the count.   AD  In a statement, the bureau said it was “obligated to comply with the Court’s Order” and was “taking immediate steps to do so. . . . Enumeration will continue.”  Plaintiffs in this and other census-related cases have accused the administration of seeking to rush and manipulate the census count to give an advantage to Republicans in representation and funding.

It is a watershed moment from an unlikely author that means gay, lesbian and transgender workers are protected by federal civil rights law. It is a stunning defeat for judicial conservatives who worked to ensure Gorsuch's nomination and Republicans, including Donald Trump, who stymied President Barack Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court, liberal Merrick Garland in 2016.  The ruling puts Gorsuch in the history books.  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, Gorsuch wrote, which bars discrimination \"because of sex,\" also covers claims based on sexual orientation and gender identity  But for close observers of his writings and actions on the bench, Gorsuch simply was showcasing his fidelity to rules of statutory interpretation -- relying on the plain text of the law -- that were championed by the late Justice Antonin Scalia . It is the clearest example yet that Gorsuch, who is by any definition a conservative judge and has cast key votes in the past siding with the President, is capable of flexing his independence, charting a distinctive course and disrupting expectations.  At the same time, it will infuriate those who worked on his confirmation, confident that he was the right candidate to fill the shoes of Scalia.  Just after the opinion was released, Carrie Severino of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network blasted Gorsuch. She said he had \"bungled\" the decision and Scalia would be disappointed.  \"This was not judging, this was legislating -- a brute force attack on our constitutional system,\" Severino, who also clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas, said.  That point was not lost on Justice Samuel Alito in his dissent that was joined by Thomas.  \"There is only one word for what the Court has done today: legislation. The document that the Court releases is in the form of a judicial opinion interpreting a statute, but that is deceptive,\" Alito wrote. Repeatedly, in his dissent, Alito quoted past writings of Scalia.  \"The Court's opinion is like a pirate ship,\" Alito said. \"It sails under a textualist flag, but what it actually represents is a theory of statutory interpretation that Justice Scalia excoriated -- the theory that courts should 'update' old statutes so that they better reflect the current values of society. \"  Joining Gorsuch were Chief Justice John Roberts, and the four liberals on the bench, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer. The liberals chose not to write concurring opinions, allowing Gorsuch's ringing endorsement of LGBTQ rights and sound rejection of Trump administration arguments, to stand alone.  JUST WATCHED Toobin: This is fascinating and enormously important Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Toobin: This is fascinating and enormously important 01:36  The vacancy that helped Trump win the White House  When Scalia died in February 2016, it threw the presidential election into turmoil. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, declared he would block any Obama nominee, who turned out to be Garland.  Trump used the vacancy as a key motivator to his base and his eventual victory, and has continued to tout his nomination of Gorsuch and later Brett Kavanaugh -- and nearly 200 lower court judges -- as legacy achievements of his presidency.  When Trump introduced Gorsuch to the country in January 2017, under the glittering lights of the East Room of the White House, he said he was fulfilling a pledge to \"find the very best judge in the country for the Supreme Court.\"  \"I promised,\" the President said, \"to select someone who respects our laws\" and someone who will \"interpret them as written.\" Trump was nodding to the fact that Scalia and Gorsuch both considered themselves \"textualists\" -- interpreting the laws as they are written, relying upon the text and the structure of the statute instead of considering what Congress might have meant, or any legislative history associated with the law.  Gorsuch's nomination would not be easy as he would have to face the fury of liberals, still incandescent that Republicans had refused to hold hearings for Garland.  At the White House that night, with Scalia's widow, Maureen, in the audience, Gorsuch called Scalia a \"lion of the law\" and he reiterated something he would repeat over the next weeks and months: \"It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people's representatives.\"  Speaking at the White House, Trump called the decision \"very powerful\" and acknowledged it was surprising to some.  \"They've ruled and we live with the decision,\" Trump said. \"We live with the decision of the Supreme Court.\"   On the bench  After taking the bench, Gorsuch wasted no time delivering for conservatives. He voted in favor of Trump's travel ban, and he would have allowed a citizenship question to be added to the 2020 census.  He was in the majority when the Court said it would stay out of disputes over when politicians go too far in drawing district lines for partisan gain. In one particular case, he sided with the court's liberals in favor of an immigrant, holding that the law used against him was impermissibly vague. There, though, Gorsuch was following the lead of Scalia, who also railed against vagueness.  In November 2017, before a crowd of conservatives attending the annual gala of the Federalist Society, Gorsuch payed homage to Scalia's work to revitalize how statutory and constitutional texts should be interpreted. Scalia believed that the Constitution should be interpreted according to its original public meaning. He also believed that a judge should start with the text when analyzing a law, and not look to legislative history or statements related to the law's purpose.  \"Tonight, I can report that a person can be both a publicly committed originalist and textualist and can be confirmed to the Supreme Court,\" Gorsuch told the delighted black tie crowd. In return, they roared their approval.  For liberals, Gorsuch represented a sure signal of the court's coming rightward tilt. In an interview with CNN last September, on the eve of the current blockbuster term, Gorsuch was asked specifically about the LGBTQ case as well as a case concerning immigration and the fear of liberals concerning the direction of the court.  In his response, Gorsuch explained how he tackled divisive cases.  \"I think all a judge can do is fulfill his or her oath as best they can,\" he said, and added \"politics, your personal points of view -- you leave that over there.\"  \"When you put on the robe, \" he continued, \"you put that stuff aside and you open your mind, and you listen. And that's all a judge can ever promise. He can't promise outcomes- can only promise their best efforts in the process.\"  At the time Gorsuch was promoting his book, \"A Republic, If You Can Keep it.\" In it he outlined his judicial philosophy. \"Textualism offers a known and knowable methodology for judges to determine impartially and fix what the law is, not simply declare what it ought to be -- a method to discern the written law's content without extraneous value judgments about persons or policies,\" he wrote.  When the court heard oral arguments in the LGBT cases in October, Gorsuch hinted at the direction he was headed.  \"When a case is really close, really close, on the textual evidence, I'm with you on textual evidence,\" he told David Cole, a lawyer representing a transgender plaintiff. \"It's close.\"   The Kagan factor  That line of questioning in October was also touched upon by Kagan, a savvy liberal who respected and admired Scalia even though they were often on opposite sides of the ideological spectrum. (Scalia famously even suggested that Obama nominate Kagan when there was an opening available.)  Kagan told an audience at Harvard in 2015 that Scalia would go down in history as one of the most \"important, historic figures of the court. She said the primary reason was that Scalia reshaped the way judges approached statutory interpretation by insisting upon a sharp focus on the words on the page.  She noted that the \"textualism\" approach could lead to different outcomes, but that Scalia insisted that the analysis start --at the very least --with the text and structure of the law and not something like the intent of Congress or committee reports and drafting history .  \"We are all textualists now,\" Kagan declared.  \"For many years, the lodestar of this Court's statutory interpretation has been the text of a statute,\" she told Solicitor General Noel Francisco , representing the Trump administration that was challenging efforts to expand the reach of the Civil Rights Act  She said the text of Title VII that bars discrimination \"because of\" sex seemed crystal clear.  \"Did you discriminate against somebody,\" she asked rhetorically, \"because of sex?\"  \"Yes you did,\" she said, answering her own question. \"Because you fired the person because this was a man who loved other men.\"  Francisco, a former Scalia clerk, fired back. He said that it was his side that was making a \"straightforward textual argument.\"  For Francisco it was simple, \"the law distinguishes between between sex and sexual orientation.\"  \"Sex means whether you're male or female, not whether you're gay or straight,\" he said.  Trump's other nominee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, dissented from Gorsuch's majority opinion  While \"policy arguments\" to amend the law \"are very weighty, Kavanaugh wrote, and while he agreed that \"gay and lesbian Americans cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth\" he could not side with Gorsuch's interpretation  \"We are judges, not Members of Congress,\" Kavanaugh wrote, adding \"our role is not to make or amend the law.\"  JUST WATCHED Gorsuch: Nine people shouldn't tell America how to live Replay More Videos ...

Roberts, like other justices often says the press makes too much of the importance of 5-4 opinions. Indeed, Monday's opinion comes as the court is considering abortion, DACA, religious liberty, and Trump's bid to shield his financial documents. Court watchers will be waiting to see how the court's usual bedfellows align.  As for Gorsuch, back in September he told CNN he rejects talk of \"hard right turns\" on the bench.  \"I just don't view judges that way, I reject that idea of how judges operate,\" he said.  He pointed out that about 40% of the courts cases are unanimous.  \"You have nine very independent people approaching these cases as best they can,\" Gorusch said.

Safer roads.   Healthier neighborhoods.  All Californians can help their communities secure these resources and more by participating in the 2020 Census before September 30. It’s as simple as answering nine easy questions online or on the phone.  As we continue to address the double pandemics of COVID-19 and systemic racism, many of us are thinking about the world we want to live in, and how we can make it better and safer for the next generation. The Census gives us an opportunity to lay the groundwork for securing the funding that communities need to thrive.  An official count of the population, the Census is used by every level of government to decide funding for our children’s schools, childcare programs, and nutrition and health resources.  The answers you give today will affect us every day for the next ten years. Whether or not you take the Census will impact your 6-year-old until they are in high school.  The Census has helped us tell our American story since the first survey was conducted in 1790. It’s a count of everyone living in the United States, regardless of background, immigration status or citizenship. It paints a proud picture of who we are, informs political representation and determines funding for the foundation of our lives.  By taking the Census, you will help secure billions of dollars of funding for your community, tribal nation and state. You will ensure you and your neighbors are represented in Sacramento and Washington, D.C. Communities that have more people officially counted have greater representation in the legislature and the Congress, and they have more funding available to assist with the community needs based on this official count.  The Census gives us the chance to say, “we’re here, we matter and we know what our kids and communities deserve.”  We are proud that California is the most diverse state in the world’s most diverse democracy. Every community in our golden state is unique and each deserves to be counted. But not every community has been counted as they should.  Native Americans, immigrants, non-English speakers, diverse communities and children are among those most often missed by the count. An undercount would take away the power of our voices and count us out of the decisions that affect us. And it would put our future and funding at risk, resulting in less money for our hospitals, fire departments and schools. For every person left uncounted, California could lose $1,000 per person each year for the next ten years.  It’s our mission to include every community in the Census count, including ones who have previously been left out due to language and cultural barriers, fear or misinformation. In California, we are taking the Census as seriously as we take our children’s futures. We’ve made historic investments in ensuring every single person living in California – especially those in hard-to-count communities – is counted. That includes working with non-profit organizations and ethnic media partners to ensure we reach every Californian in the language they speak.  You may have already received instructions in the mail on how to fill out the Census form. If you didn’t, you can still fill out the form online at my2020census.gov or by phone at 844-330-2020. Assistance is available on the phone in several languages. If you received a paper form in the mail, you can fill it out and mail it back.  Make sure you count everyone in your household, including children, and do it before September 30.  As you’re filling out the Census, know that it is safe and confidential. The information collected cannot be shared or used against you in any way. Census data cannot be used for law enforcement purposes or shared with landlords. The Census Bureau will never ask for your Social Security Number, financial information or money. And the 2020 Census is prohibited from asking about immigration or citizenship status.  Right now, Census teams are going door-to-door to follow up with people who have not responded. They are following all public health guidelines, trained to wear a mask and ask the Census questions from outside your home. You can tell if the person is an official Census taker by their I.D. badge and Census Bureau-issued phone.  Remember that by answering these nine easy questions and ensuring a complete count, you are creating a brighter future for your community.  As parents, there is nothing we would not do for our children. This year, add “taking the Census before September 30” to that list.

In a Wall Street Journal column in August, he and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson promised to protect the suburbs from being transformed into “dysfunctional cities.” And in a tweet several days later, Trump warned that suburban women should be wary of Democrats, as they would allow crime to drift into suburban communities. More recently, the president has grown less subtle, imploring suburban women at his rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, last week to like him. “[C]an I ask you to do me a favor, suburban women? Will you please like me? Please. Please. I saved your damn neighborhood, OK?”  How does early voting affect the forecast? l FiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast  The suburbs, in Trump’s telling, are under siege — and a Joe Biden presidency would transform them beyond recognition. But it might be that Trump doesn’t actually recognize what suburbia looks like today.  [Live Updates: We’re Tracking The Vote And Voting Problems]  Establishing what constitutes a “suburb” is hard; there is no single definition, and what’s more, in the past 40 years, the suburbs have become much more diverse. This is bad news for Trump, as his vision of suburbia seems largely stuck in the 1950s — a manicured lawn, a husband heading into the city to work at a white-collar job, and a “housewife” tending to the children and preparing dinner. Only this version of suburbia doesn’t really exist anymore.  It wasn’t that long ago, though, that Trump had an edge among suburban voters. In 2016, Trump won them, 47 percent to 45 percent, according to an analysis of validated voters by the Pew Research Center. But by 2018, 52 percent of suburban voters supported Democratic candidates for Congress, compared with 45 percent who supported Republican candidates. And according to our analysis of polling data from Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape, Trump is losing suburban voters to Biden, by 54 percent to 44 percent.  What is driving this move away from Trump and Republicans in the suburbs? According to our analysis of Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape data, beyond the diversification of the suburbs, it’s mostly because of white suburban women: 54 percent of them support Biden, while just 45 percent support Trump (very few are undecided). Meanwhile, white suburban men haven’t stopped backing Trump — he’s winning them 57 percent to 41 percent. (The reason we’re zooming in on white suburban voters is that nonwhite voters in the suburbs are much more likely to say they’ll back Biden — 83 percent of Black, 69 percent of Asian/Pacific Islander, and 57 percent of Hispanic likely voters said they supported Biden, according to our analysis.)  There is, of course, still a significant share of white women in the suburbs who are on Trump’s side (45 percent), but as you can see in the chart above, white men support Trump much more overall. And Trump may actually be reaching those men with pleas ostensibly geared toward women, according to Jane Junn, a political science professor at the University of Southern California. “When he talked about suburban housewives, I think the message was as much to men as it was to women,” Junn said. “It was a shoutout to their masculinity.”  One reason why white suburban men might be more receptive to Trump’s racially coded appeals and callouts to traditional gender roles is that white suburban men tend to score higher than white suburban women on questions of racial resentment and hostile sexism, even among Democrats. The one exception to this, as the chart below shows, is among white suburban Republicans. In this case, men’s and women’s racial resentment scores are basically the same, which is somewhat expected as partisanship is a big driver of issues like racial discrimination and sexism.  However, white suburban Republican women were less likely to score high on the question we used to measure gender resentment, about whether women who complain of harassment often cause more problems than they solve. This signals that, compared with white men, they may be less receptive to Trump’s rhetoric concerning women this time around. And that could be a big problem for Trump since sexist attitudes strongly correlated with support for him in 2016.  The same is true of some of Trump’s core campaign issues, like immigration, which don’t seem to resonate as much with white suburban Republican women as with white suburban Republican men. Of the five issues we looked at, white Republican women in the suburbs were far less hard-line than their male counterparts. On some issues, like support for building a wall along the southern U.S. border with Mexico, there wasn’t much difference, but on the question of separating a child if their parents could be prosecuted for entering the U.S. illegally, the gap in support was huge: Just 25 percent of white suburban Republican women supported that policy compared with 46 percent of white suburban Republican men. There was also a sizable gap on support for the deportation of all undocumented immigrants.  White suburban Republicans are divided on immigration Share of white suburban Republican likely voters who said they support the following immigration policies, by gender Policy Men Women The border wall 75% 72% Child separation 46 25 Path to citizenship for all undocumented immigrants 41 37 Deportation of all undocumented immigrants 64 52 Path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to U.S. as children 60 64 Averaged from surveys conducted Sept. 3 to Oct. 7. Source: DEMOCRACY FUND + UCLA NATIONSCAPE  While not directly related to the law-and-order rhetoric that Trump has been leaning into recently, immigration is a good example of why Trump’s presidency may have had a souring effect on white women, but not on white men. Claiming that immigration and crime are threats to the suburbs is a strategy that often works to remind white Republican women why they’re Republican, according to Jessica Trounstine, a political science professor at University of California, Merced, but this might not land with voters in the same way this year. That’s because the white women most likely to find Trump’s messages appealing are probably the ones who stuck with the Republicans in 2018. In other words, according to Junn of USC, the white women who abandoned Republicans in 2018 aren’t likely to be persuaded to come back based on this messaging.  White suburban men, however, don’t seem to be as badly shaken, and because their more traditionalist gender views make that retro vision of the suburbs more appealing, their support for the president might even be reinforced by his talk about suburban women. The trouble for Trump is that simply holding onto the votes of white suburban men isn’t enough — he needs to make up for lost ground among white suburban women, too. But with only two weeks left until Election Day, there might not be much he can do to bring them back.

The last strokes of the pen were devoted to repudiating President Trump's claim that he is categorically immune from state grand jury and congressional subpoenas.  But the term also featured just about every flashpoint in American law — including abortion, religion, immigration and much more.   Here are six takeaways:  1. John Roberts may be the most powerful chief justice since the 1930s. He is the first justice since then to be both the controlling vote and the chief justice. That means that when he is in the majority, he has the important power to assign who will write an opinion, and that choice may well determine whether the decision is written broadly or narrowly. This term, Roberts was in the majority an astounding 97% of the time; he assigned the opinion in all but two cases.  2. Probably the most historic opinions he wrote were those rejecting Trump's claim that he is categorically immune from state grand jury and congressional subpoenas for his pre-presidential financial records.  But in an election year, Roberts also wrote a variety of decisions that for now will likely keep the court out of the political maelstrom. His signature immigration decision prevented Trump from immediately getting rid of the program that offers protections for people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, known as \"DREAMers.\" But it left ample room for conservative actions down the road.  Roberts also cast the deciding vote in a major abortion case that preserved the status quo, for now, but left plenty of leeway for the court to chip away at abortion rights in the future.  And he likely wrote the court's unsigned opinion, dismissing as moot the first major gun rights case heard by the court in a decade. That too leaves room for gun rights proponents to come back attacking gun regulations in the future.  3. Religion is the one area where social conservative won consistent victories this term. In three separate decisions, the court made clear that the high wall of separation between church and state, a doctrine that prevailed for much of the 20th century, is now a relic of the past. It has been replaced by a heavy emphasis on the free exercise of religion and an accommodation between church and state.  Roberts wrote the court's 5-to-4 decision gutting provisions in most state constitutions that have long barred using taxpayer funds for religious schools.  In another case, the court ruled that under the Constitution, lay teachers at parochial schools may not be protected by the nation's fair employment laws.  And in a third case, the court ruled that under the Affordable Care Act, employers with religious or moral objections may opt out of providing free birth control coverage in their employee insurance plans.  4. While conservatives have a clear five-justice majority, they can't seem to work together. Perhaps for reasons of either ego or frustration, conservatives wrote way more separate concurring and dissenting opinions — a total of 60 — compared to the liberals, who wrote far fewer concurring opinions and almost always dissented as a group.  The liberals seem to know they are playing defense. When they can get a fifth vote to prevail, they don't go off on their own in a way that could diminish their impact.  The four most conservative justices write many more separate opinions and are much more long-winded — their separate opinions total 734 pages.  When you drill down to the 20 cases that were decided by 5-to-4 or 6-to-3 votes, the numbers are even starker. Conservatives wrote 14 of 17 concurring opinions, meaning that they signed on to the outcome of the ruling but not on to all — or sometimes any — of the reasoning behind it. And they wrote eight of the nine solo dissents and eight of the 11 solo concurrences, writing for themselves alone.  The only time Chief Justice Roberts wrote a concurring opinion for himself alone was in the abortion case, presenting a Louisiana law identical a Texas law struck down four years ago.  Roberts, who dissented from the Texas decision, nonetheless cast the deciding fifth vote to invalidate the same law from Louisiana, citing the duty to adhere to precedent. But he did not join the liberals' reasoning, and in fact seemed to invite future cases that could undermine abortion rights.  5. Of the two Trump appointees to the court, Neil Gorsuch has been at once the most predictable and unpredictable this term. Predictable because in most cases he has turned out to be every bit as conservative as his political supporters hoped, and liberal detractors feared. But in two major majority opinions that he wrote, he completely defied early predictions.  The most headline-grabbing was his decision for a six-justice majority declaring that LGBTQ employees are protected by the 1964 law barring employment discrimination based on sex.  In another decision, on Thursday, he delivered to Native Americans their first major Supreme Court victory in many decades. Writing for himself and the court's four liberals, Gorsuch declared that much of eastern Oklahoma, including the state's second largest city of Tulsa, falls within Indian lands belonging to the Creek Nation.  Gorsuch's decision invoked the mistreatment and broken promises inflicted on Native American tribes over the course of U.S. history, and concluded that the land in eastern Oklahoma still belongs to the Creek Nation because Congress never revoked the treaties under which the land was designated as, in the words of the opinion, \"Indian Country.\"  To hold otherwise, wrote Gorsuch, would \"elevate the most brazen and longstanding injustices ... rewarding wrong and failing those in the right.\"  Although the decision could have major consequences, state and tribal officials immediately said that they could reach an amicable compromise to resolve those issues. That said, the fact is that the court's ruling has provided Native Americans the kind of leverage in negotiations that they have not had before.  6. Headline cases buried other personal court news.On June 21, Chief Justice Roberts fell while walking at a Maryland country club near his home, hitting his head hard enough to require stitches and an overnight stay in the hospital. The court did not disclose the incident when it occurred, but confirmed it on July 7, after the Washington Post first reported the incident.  Court press officer Kathy Arberg said in a statement, \"The Chief Justice was treated at a hospital on June 21 for an injury to his forehead sustained in a fall while walking for exercise near his home. The injury required sutures, and out of an abundance of caution, he stayed in the hospital overnight and was discharged the next morning.\"  Arberg said doctors had had ruled out a seizure (he suffered a seizure in 1993 and another one in 2007). She said doctors believe the fall last month \"was likely due to light-headedness caused by dehydration.\"  On a different note, Ginni Thomas, an outspoken conservative activist and wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, wrote to protest an overhead banner on Main Street in the tiny town of Clifton, Va., population 300. The banner reads, \"Welcome to Clifton, where Black Lives Matter.\"  Thomas is white; her husband is the Supreme Court's only black justice. \"BLM is a bit of a dangerous Trojan Horse and they are catching well-meaning people into the dangerous posturing that can invite mob rule and property looting,\" Ginni Thomas wrote, according to the Washington Post. \"Let's not be tricked into joining cause with radical extremists seeking to foment a cultural revolution because they hate America.\"  Copyright 2020 NPR.

She spoke out after an online hate campaign intensified against Ms Zehida Bihorac, an elementary school teacher and woman human rights defender. She works in the northwest of the country, in Una-Sana Canton bordering EU member Croatia.  Authorities trying to stop the flow have ordered refugees, migrants and asylum-seekers to camps, where there are few services. Since 2018, Ms Bihorac has given them medicine, clothes, food and sleeping bags and has documented their situation.  \"As a result of her activities, this brave woman human rights defender has been subjected to a concerted campaign by a Facebook group who have issued death threats against her and have branded her an 'immoral woman' and 'unfit to teach children',\" said Lawlor.  \"Women human rights defenders taking an active role against injustice often pay with personal attacks against themselves, their profession, their families or their decisions,\" Lawlor said, while adding that \"These defamatory messages portray those who defend the human rights of migrants as criminals instead of recognizing their legitimate work.\"  Ms. Bihorac has also been filmed, followed and verbally assaulted while performing her legitimate human rights work. She filed a complaint with the local police, but no action has been taken.  \"We urge the Bosnian government to conduct prompt, independent and impartial investigations on the attacks against Ms Zehida Bihorac and bring those responsible to justice according to international standards,\" said Lawlor.  It's equally important that countries recognize the rights, needs and contributions of people on the move, she said.  \"Migration is intrinsic to the history of humanity, and will continue to occur,\" said Lawlor. \"We need supportive societies who are ready to welcome migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. People leave their homelands to escape systematic violence, persecution, poverty, lack of employment, scarce opportunities, climate change and because they have no way to live a dignified life.

An Associated Press review of those states found that at least 10 — also including Iowa — in some instances share the names of everyone who has tested positive.  Sharing the information does not violate medical privacy laws, according to guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Law enforcement officials say the information helps them take precautions when responding to a call to avoid contracting and spreading the virus.  But civil liberty and community activists have expressed concerns of potential profiling in African-American and Hispanic communities that already have an uneasy relationship with law enforcement. Some envision the data being forwarded to immigration officials.  Critics wonder why first responders don’t just take extra precautions with everyone, given that so many people with the virus are asymptomatic or present only mild symptoms.  In Iowa, hundreds of workers at meatpacking plants have been tested for the coronavirus after outbreaks idled plants in Perry, Waterloo and Columbus Junction. Many workers who tested positive for COVID-19 are minorities and immigrants.  Latinos make up just 6 percent of Iowa’s population, for instance, but constitute 25 percent of all Iowans who have tested positive.  The AP review shows that public health officials in at least 35 states share the addresses of those who have tested positive with first responders who request it. In at least 10 of those states, health agencies may also share their names: Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Tennessee. Wisconsin did so briefly but stopped earlier this month.  Agencies in the Corridor say the addresses are shared under strict controls to databases. So if first responders are called to an address that is flagged, the crew knows in advance what precautions are needed.  Agencies surveyed by The Gazette said the information they receive does not include names.  Sam Jarvis, community health manager for Johnson County Public Health, said the department shares addresses — but not names — with the county’s Joint Emergency Communication Center. One person enters the information into the dispatch system so if a 911 comes in for that address, responders know in advance what level of personal protective gear is needed.  “We have the process set up (so) that as persons recover, those addresses are removed,” Jarvis said in an email.  Thomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said law enforcement agencies should assure minority communities that the information won’t be turned over to the federal government.  He noted the Trump administration’s demands that local governments cooperate with immigration authorities as a concern.  Law enforcement officials note they have long been entrusted with confidential information, including Social Security numbers and criminal history. The COVID-19 information, they say, is just a continuation of that trend.  According to the national Fraternal Order of Police, more than 100 police officers in the United States have died from the coronavirus.  Lee Hermiston and Kat Russell of The Gazette contributed.

And we are no longer talking about the fact that the only Latino candidate had to give up the race, or that the campaign plans of most of those who remain are still a little flimsy.  We're talking about their ability to speak directly to the community, answer its questions, and not choke on words in the process.  Proof of that were the random answers former Vice President Joe Biden gave to leaders of the Hispanic community in Nevada last weekend.  At a town hall meeting at Rancho High School last Saturday, the candidate who has led the polls nationwide was unable to give an objective answer to key questions such as his intention to pass comprehensive immigration reform during his first 100 days in office, or his commitment to include Latinos in his cabinet.  According to the Nevada Independent, Biden avoided questions posed by moderator Hector Sanchez Barba, executive director of Mi Familia Vota, refuting to give exact numbers or solid proposals on critical issues such as deportation.  “There’s a simple reason for this. It’s a simple proposition,” Biden said. “Latinos make up 25 percent of every single solitary person in school in America. The idea that we are not going to have overwhelming representation of Latinos and Latinos in my cabinet says we’re not going to move forward as a country. You are the future of this country.”  In this way, the candidate was mechanically repeating the political rhetoric with which the Hispanic community in the country has been approached even before the 2016 elections, promising to always take us into account but not explaining how.  While he tried to shed light on the deportation process, promising \"that only immigrants who have committed felonies would be deported during his administration,\" that he would increase the number of refugees admitted to the country to 125,000 and that he would put an end to the separation of families, Biden could not promise that immigration reform would be introduced in his first 100 days in office.  \"I can't guarantee it in the first 100, it will be sent in the first 100, but I can't guarantee it,\" he said.  While the former vice president's political project includes the introduction of immigration reform during the first 100 days of his administration, approving it is a different matter. According to Isabel Aldunate, Deputy Director of Strategic Communications and Press Secretary for Biden's Hispanic Media, the candidate \"cannot commit to passing legislation within the first 100 days because he acknowledges the need to work with Congress (especially one whose Senate is Republican-controlled) and is being honest with the American people about that.\"  \"Congress is subject to many variables including the upcoming Senate and House elections. It is dishonest to promise legislation will be passed and Joe Biden has always valued transparency and honesty,\" she added in an email.  In a conversation with the Biden campaign, AL DÍA asked: \"Why should Latinos vote for Biden?\"  Laura Jimenez, Director of the National Latino Vote, answered: “Latinos should vote for Joe Biden because a Biden presidency would represent a sea change from the current status quo.\"  In an email, Jimenez added that, after being terrorized for the past 3 years, \"the Latino community recognizes that we are in a battle for the soul of the nation and are at a moral and political crossroads.\"  \"The Latino community knows and respects Joe Biden, and knows that he will prioritize the issues that are important to them. Furthermore, Biden’s ideas and policies to help the Latino community are realistic and doable as opposed to the empty promises that both Donald Trump and other candidates have put forth,” she concluded.  The former vice president's participation in the town hall meeting is part of a shared effort by some candidates to try to get the Latino vote within days of the Iowa Caucus.  During the same weekend, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg also made an effort to convince members of the Latino Culinary Union that his campaign takes into account the priorities of Hispanics.  According to the Washington Post, Buttigieg advocated \"a path to citizenship for all 11 million undocumented people in the country,\" and promised to reinstate the Deferred Action program as soon as he steps into the White House.  However, as the midterm elections showed, the range of priorities of the Latino community continues to be overlooked.  Health care, education, and quality of life are key priorities for Latinos, who see far beyond the immigration proposals used by the Republican campaign to take over the opposite bench.  Perhaps that's why the Independent Senator from Vermont has the most Latino support.  After incorporating key figures for the community such as Bronx Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortéz, Sanders has increased his support in the Hispanic community by 7%, according to figures published by Morning Consult on January 7.  One way or another, it seems that there is still no candidate who understands a mass of voters who could radically change the results next November.

Photo / Faye Sakura, The New York Times  The Black Lives Matter movement has offered a rare moment for the descendants of plantation labourers brought aboard ships in the 19th century to make their family histories known.  Marion Healy's great-grandfather Kwailu was just a boy when \"recruiters\" took him aboard a ship on a beach in the Solomon Islands. The destination was Australia, where, for meagre wages, he would do backbreaking labour planting and cutting sugar cane for white farmers.  Thousands of South Pacific islanders like Kwailu were lured to Australian plantations in the 19th century, some through deception, others through force, and all through a colonialism that looted less-advantaged societies. So when Healy recently heard Prime Minister Scott Morrison say that there had been \"no slavery in Australia,\" she wondered whether her people's history, already little known, could be lost entirely.  \"How dare you say that?\" she said of the prime minister. \"I'm a bit frightened that we might slip out of their memory.\"  The Black Lives Matter movement, as it has swept the globe, has led Australia to look more deeply at entrenched discrimination against its Indigenous peoples and other minorities. Morrison's remark, for which he later apologised, focused particular attention on outwardly racist policies in Australia's past, a legacy many tend to overlook in a country that proclaims itself proudly multicultural.  Healy and others descended from South Pacific labourers are often confused with Indigenous Australians, whose ancestors were the continent's first inhabitants and have faced similar discrimination. Although South Pacific labourers were not the only ones engaged in such work, the prime minister's comment has created an opportunity for their descendants to cement a distinct identity.  Delivering sugar cane to a mill in Mackay. The industry owes its early prosperity in part to South Sea Islander labourers. Photo / Faye Sakura, The New York Times  \"It's a chance to have our story told,\" Healy said. \"We need to take that opportunity.\"  That story begins with the need for inexpensive labour in Britain's colonies, which pushed Australia as close to abject bondage as was allowed after the British Empire abolished slavery in 1833.  Chattel slavery, as practised in America and elsewhere, meant that enslaved people were treated as the property of their masters to be bought, sold and exploited. The children of the enslaved were automatically born into slavery.  But in Australia, the British found cheap workers in the indentured labour of Indigenous Australians, Chinese, Indians, white convicts and South Pacific islanders.

Photo / Faye Sakura, The New York Times  Some historians say that the more than 50,000 South Pacific islanders who worked largely on the sugar plantations of northeastern Australia from 1863 to 1904 were not technically enslaved because they were paid for their toil, albeit typically much less than white workers. Some labourers, including Kwailu, who returned to their home islands in the South Pacific ended up coming back to Australia.  \"But there was kidnapping. Nobody would argue against that,\" said Clive Moore, an emeritus professor at the University of Queensland who has extensively studied the history of the labourers, known in Australia as South Sea Islanders.  Large numbers of the cane workers were \"blackbirded\": lured from their island homes, some with the promise of items like axes and knives — valuable goods in a less industrialised society. Many of the South Sea Islanders did not survive their years of labour on the plantations.  Their toil helped make the colony, and later the state, of Queensland prosperous. But instead of recognising the South Sea Islanders for their contributions, Australia sought to erase them from the record.  A monument erected in 1994 to honour the South Sea Islanders who helped establish Mackay's sugar cane industry. Photo / Faye Sakura, The New York Times  One of the country's first acts as a new nation in 1901 was to enact frameworks intended to keep the country ethnically European, the so-called White Australia policy. The country deported a majority of the cane workers and banned their reentry. A small number received exemptions, while others hid from immigration agents with the help of sympathetic farmers.  Those who remained in Australia were often reluctant to revisit the past as a result. That has meant that younger generations are sometimes unaware of their family histories, with gaps in the oral histories that are traditionally handed down.  \"I didn't know my cultural identity until later on,\" said Cody Bobongie, 26, who, like many younger South Sea Islanders, finds the legacy of trauma a daunting weight to carry. \"It's like I lost something I never had.\"  The country's largest population of South Sea Islanders, who number an estimated 20,000, live in the Mackay region of coastal Queensland. It is a place speckled with reminders of the legacy of blackbirding, but also a painful awareness — reinforced by the prime minister's slavery comment — that, without a fight, memories will fade.  A traditional hut near the city's lush gardens has become a cherished meeting place. A mural showing Mackay (pronounced muh-KAI) through the years depicts the South Sea Islanders' journey by ship and their symbolic transformation into blackbirds.

He led a team that looked through cemetery records to help identify the graves. \"These were the ones that never went back to the islands,\" he said.  Vea Vea said he dreamed of creating a heritage trail that would lead people through the area's significant sites, from the graves to the cane fields.

As part of this, she is hosting a program where elders teach students how to weave traditional fishing nets.  Ivey grew up with her great-grandmother, who was brought to Australia at the age of 8 and became a maid for a white family. She was kept and fed but not paid more than that. \"She used to hold up the atlas and tell me that she was from New Hebrides,\" now known as Vanuatu, Ivey said.  Many in Mackay know little about this history, she said, \"which is why we're the forgotten people.\" She believes that passing on the culture to all Mackay residents, not just South Sea Islanders, is crucial.  The city's population of about 80,000 has grown increasingly diverse, with nearby mines underpinning the arrival of new workers, some of whom are unaware of the area's history. The mayor, Greg Williamson, said that Mackay should be forthright about how its prosperity had come at the suffering of South Sea Islanders.  The artifacts room in the South Sea Islanders' hut in Mackay. Photo / Faye Sakura, The New York Times  \"There's absolutely no sense in denying any of that happened,\" said Williamson, an independent who, along with South Sea Islanders, invited Morrison to visit Mackay for a history lesson.  The city, he added, had investigated whether its namesake, a Scottish-born explorer named John Mackay, had any connection to blackbirding. Williamson said that he and the Mackay family were fairly confident he was not involved, but Moore has found evidence indicating that he was.  Instruction in South Sea Islander history, unlike lessons on Aboriginal Australians, is not compulsory in Australian schools. Healy and others in Mackay believe that should change.

Photo / Faye Sakura, The New York Times  The importance of preserving these stories struck Healy a few years ago when she visited Malaita, the island in the Solomons where her great-grandfather was born. As she approached the village he had been taken from so many years ago, she heard drums and singing: a welcome from the village people that brought her to tears.  \"It made sense to me, when you hear Aboriginal people talk about going home to country,\" she said, referring to a concept of returning to and connecting with one's traditional lands. \"Then did I feel like I was home.\"   Written by: Isabella Kwai   Photographs by: Faye Sakura  © 2020 THE NEW YORK TIMES  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 21, "positive": 71, "negative": 10, "disgust": 5, "joy": 7, "anger": 18, "surprise": 1, "fear": 7, "trust": 4}, "metadata": ["minister", "people's", "australia", "discrimination", "focused", "racist", "legacy", "britain's", "british", "america", "children", "professor", "university", "country's", "immigration", "city's", "district", "education", "students", "denying", "independent", "investigated", "john", "connecting"]}, {"text": "A Bureau of Immigration (BI) official on Monday assured senators that the issuance of visas upon arrival (VUA) remains suspended amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Javier said this in response to Sen. Maria Josefa Imelda Marcos’ question during a Senate hearing on the proposed 2021 national budget.

Sen. Risa Hontiveros, chair of the Senate women’s panel, expressed belief that the VUA mechanism was instrumental to the increasing number of gambling-related prostitution dens in the Philippines.

This decision brings reprieve to many who have worried about the program’s future since its announced rescission. Where do we go from here? We celebrate … and then steel ourselves for the next fight. DACA was never a permanent solution and it has only confirmed the need for comprehensive immigration reform.  Over the past eight years, DACA has shown us the power of legal protections for undocumented immigrants, and the peril of persistent lack of access to permanent legal status. DACA gave more than 800,000 undocumented young adults who came to the U.S. as children access to a work permit and protection from deportation.  For my research on the effects on immigration policy, I interviewed 72 DACA recipients in California in 2011-2012 – before DACA began – and then again in 2015 when they were DACA beneficiaries. They reported substantial changes in their economic situations, with their average incomes increasing by almost $500 a month.  Out of every five interviewees, one moved to a “better” job, one obtained professional employment, and one pursued new educational opportunities. About three-quarters obtained a driver’s license, and all the others had a California ID card. Other studies find similar benefits.  My book, “Of Love and Papers: How Immigration Policy Affects Romance and Family” shows that the material benefits of DACA translated directly into benefits for entire families. Receiving DACA made dating, marriage, and parenting easier for undocumented young adults. Before DACA, financial concerns and deportation fears discouraged many from marrying and having children.  One young man shared with me that DACA gave him the financial stability he desired to allow him to finally propose to his girlfriend of many years. Citizen romantic partners reported feeling relief as they no longer had to help their undocumented partner navigate everyday legal barriers. Countless parents affirmed that it empowered them to better care for and provide for their children. DACA allowed them to invest in building their families up, rather than just getting by.  The success of the DACA program has given us a glimpse of what benefits await society if we provide legal status to all undocumented immigrants. But it also shows us the dangers of continuing to delay this move.  Despite obtaining a liminally legal status, the imprint of undocumented status remained in the lives of DACA recipients I interviewed. Undocumented young adults could not simply press pause as they waited for legal changes. Instead, they chose partners and made seemingly innocuous, but still significant, decisions about where to go on dates, if they should drive, or if they could enroll their children in an after-school activity. They made, or avoided making, life-altering commitments to partner, marry, or have children.  For many parents, legal changes came too late; they had missed their chance to provide their children with opportunities when they were needed or desired. All these choices caused lasting damage: emotional scars, internalized negative feelings, and limited social and human capital.  My survey research with hundreds of undocumented college students in California shows the dangers of legal uncertainty for educational and economic integration. Undocumented high school and college students may give up on pursuing their education because they do not believe that they will use their degree to pursue a career and upward mobility.

Additionally, our survey research shows that immigration issues can distract undocumented students from their studies; news of a recent ICE raid may prevent them from studying or paying attention in class as they worry about their family’s safety.  These small moments can have far-reaching, cumulative consequences—lowering their course grades and GPAs. In these ways, past experiences forever structure opportunities because they cannot be undone after a more secure legal status is obtained.  Exclusionary immigration policies have hurt undocumented immigrants, their U.S. citizen family members and U.S. society enough. The Supreme Court decision has delivered one victory. But there have been many more losses. The war will not be won until we have relief for all 11 million undocumented immigrants, their families, and our communities.  Laura E.

Unlike the Great Depression and the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008-2009, this crisis cannot be directly attributed to the dysfunctional workings of capitalism. But even if it is not a crisis of capitalism, it is a crisis for capitalism. Chronic ills of contemporary capitalism – notably rising levels of socio-economic inequality and debt of all kinds – are being exacerbated and intensify the danger of further political polarization and fresh financial instability.  Capitalism will nonetheless survive this crisis as it has done previous ones. The fundamental structures of capitalism typically don’t change fast. But they can change and they do, especially at critical historical junctures, such as in response to wars and economic crises – or, potentially, pandemics.   State interventionism  Compared with recent decades, in post-Covid-19 capitalism the state will emerge as a more dominant actor. Even more than in the years after the GFC, central banks have been resorting to increasingly unorthodox, expansionary monetary policies to stave off economic collapse. To the same end governments have begun and will continue to pursue expansionary fiscal policies and run up ever-higher budget deficits. Austerity policies have suddenly become unfashionable. Sectoral or “industrial” policies have regained favour, with governments everywhere intervening to assist firms in those sectors, such as air transport or tourism, which the crisis otherwise would destroy. Policies to “re-localize” production of critical goods in crises, such as medical equipment and supplies, are suddenly in vogue, whereas state aid policies aimed at preventing distortions of competition are not. The intellectual champions of the free market have fallen silent.  Regardless of how fast the world economy recovers from the crisis, longer-term factors – possible new pandemics and pressures to mitigate or adapt to climate change or, in the “old” advanced capitalist economies, to create a more level playing field against firms aided by the Chinese state – will keep the pressure on governments to maintain or strengthen existing levels of state intervention.  To say that the state will be a more dominant actor in post-Covid-19 capitalism is not to say, however, that previously divergent capitalisms are converging on a uniform “statist” model. State economic intervention can manifest highly divergent forms. Here the 1930s may offer some salient parallels. Higher levels of state intervention characterized countries that moved politically to the left as well as to the (far) right. Numerous countries, such as in Sweden and New Zealand, where Labour and Social Democratic parties came to power in this period, or the US under President Roosevelt, embarked on Keynesian deficit-spending policies that reduced mass unemployment, strengthened organized labour and expanded collective social welfare provision.  At the other end of the politico-ideological spectrum, fascist or Nazi regimes, such as Mussolini’s Italy and Hitler’s Germany, also engaged in large-scale deficit-spending, while destroying liberal democracy, smashing the labour movement, implementing protectionist economic policies, and mobilizing their societies for war.   Growing polarization  In the wake of the coronavirus crisis, the democratic-capitalist world may well undergo a process of political polarization comparable to what occurred in the 1930s. Depending on the shifting distribution of domestic political power, countries may tend toward one or the other of two scenarios. In one, which might be labelled “yellow capitalism” (combining the colours Social Democratic red and green), state intervention would aim to redistribute income and wealth on a greater scale than is the case in most capitalist democracies today and to take more sweeping measures to combat global warming.  ‘Yellow capitalism\" would be fundamentally internationalist, recognizing the fact that the most severe challenges facing humankind are global and can be managed effectively only through comprehensive international cooperation. But it would create scope for governments to protect their economies for specific purposes, such as to combat climate change, for example through carbon tariffs. In this scenario, private business would be much more tightly constrained by state regulation than at the peak of neo-liberal capitalism after the Cold War.  The core support for this incarnation of capitalism, which synthesizes the aspirations of the “old” labour movement and “new” social, especially environmental, movements, would be found in the (especially younger) professional middle classes in the big cities and towns and the unionized working class. Even centrist political parties could support this kind of political agenda.  The other scenario (combining the colour black for nationalism and brown for right-wing populism) might be termed “light-black capitalism”. Like “yellow capitalism”, it would also be highly interventionist, but would be fiscally regressive rather than redistributive, as has been the thrust of President Trump’s tax policy in the US. Climate change would be ignored in favour of maximizing (quantitative) economic growth. Domestic business would be increasingly protected from international competition, while comprehensive immigration controls would offer the (ethnically defined) “people” some protection from the competition of “foreign” workers. The core support for “light-black capitalism” would be in domestic-market-oriented business, among residents of small towns, villages and the countryside as well as in declining industrial regions, among “value conservatives” afraid that changes in dominant social values are destroying traditional norms and life-styles, and among “status anxious” workers hostile to immigration.   Rising risks  Which of these two incarnations of a state-interventionist capitalism – “yellow” or “light-black” – becomes the predominant form in the post-coronavirus era will be determined by the outcomes of political struggle and conflict in mostly national political arenas. The only thing that is certain is that, for the time being at least, market-friendly incarnations of capitalism will wither.  So far, in the coronavirus crisis, citizens in most countries have rallied to their governments in a spirit of national unity akin to what has occasionally happened historically at the outbreak of wars. However, we are currently still passing through the first stage – the public-health phase – of the coronavirus crisis. Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies and the subsidization – on a massive scale – of short-time work have enabled most governments to postpone the arrival of the second, the economic and financial, phase of the crisis. But unless the recovery of the world economy is very rapid, this next phase will materialize. It will be all the more destructive now that a second wave of the coronavirus is upon is, requiring new lockdown measures that will exacerbate the economic problems caused by those taken earlier this year.  This phase of the crisis will likely witness greater, perhaps much greater, social and political upheaval than the first. Regardless of how well or badly some national-populist governments have hitherto managed the crisis so far, the growing socio-economic dislocation and insecurity that will increasingly characterize this second phase of the crisis could give movements based on this kind of ideology a powerful new impetus.  An upsurge of “light-black capitalism” would likely plunge the world economy into an even deeper recession. Even more ominously, it would also increase the probability of large-scale military conflict. As the American economist Otto Mallery wrote during the Second World War: “When goods don’t cross borders, soldiers will”. In this regard too, the events and trends of the 1930s still provide us today with lessons that we ignore at our peril.

The lengths to which Taylor went to fabricate the appearance of exculpatory evidence two years in advance make perfect sense once it became clear that this man is complicit in crimes against humanity. He worked with Nielsen to help whitewash and downplay the horrors of the child separation project, which tore thousands of innocent, young children away from their parents and incarcerated them in private-prison run concentration camps to be neglected and systematically abused by their jailors.  Buzzfeed reports that “But his own emails prove that not only was he there prior to its enactment, he even helped prepare its roll out — in an email to former DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in the days before the policy was announced, he sent her talking points with the Orwellian title, ‘Protecting Children Narrative.'”  Add your name to demand Pence stop endangering lives to campaign as the virus spreads through his inner circle!   Sponsored Links  Barely more than a week ago, Taylor was arguing that the Trump administration couldn’t find the parents of 545 children because their parents didn’t want them anymore. It’s hard to put into words how monstrous that statement is considering that Taylor and the rest of the Department of Homeland Security failed to keep an accurate record of where the children and their parents were sent.   Sponsored Links  A few days ago, Taylor said the reason the Trump administration couldn't find the parents of 545 migrant children was that their parents didn't want them These were children who were separated by Trump administration policy that he helped administer (He deleted the tweet.) pic.twitter.com/lNirBLV6O3 — Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) October 28, 2020   Sponsored Links  Not only was he involved in the child separation policy and the unimaginable suffering that was needlessly inflicted on thousands upon thousands of young kids whose parents had committed the crime of seeking a better life for their children, but he was also directly involved in the development of the Trump policy’s next illegal attempt to punish and deter migrants.  NBC News reports that Miles Taylor was directly involved in the development of the “Remain in Mexico” policy, which was also an exercise in deliberate cruelty. The “Migrant Protection Protocols” involved deporting tens of thousands of immigrants to dangerous Mexico border towns to await an asylum hearing which usually would never grant aslyum.  66,000 people, including more than 20,000 children, have been sent to Mexico, where they are deposited in overwhelmed refugee camps and left to be preyed upon by vicious cartel gangs. Immigration activist group RAICES reports that there have been over 1,114 crimes committed against the MPP migrants, including murder, rape, torture, and kidnapping. 265 of the victims are children.  Miles Taylor was directly involved and complicit in not one but two ethnic cleansing programs designed to inflict cruelty and trauma on some of the world’s most vulnerable people on behalf of a wildly corrupt and sadistic President and his agenda of naked white supremacy.  Taylor clearly has no regrets about what he’s done, judging from his recent tweets; instead, he cynically is trying to set himself up for a post-Trump career of book deals and MSNBC contributor appearances like every scumbag ex-Republican from the Bush administration successfully did during the Trump era. He probably believes that his self-unmasking will lead him to be hailed as a hero for “resisting Trump” within the organization.  Instead, it exposes him as not just a greedy coward but as a monster who should be facing a tribunal for crimes against humanity.  We want to hear what YOU have to say.

Little did they know it would come with a catch. Canada Border Services Agency actually had its own rules when applying the government order.  Aucoin didn’t expect his American wife, Adrienne Berg Yorinks, to have trouble coming home to Cape Breton. The couple’s only concern returning from Florida was being able to drive through Maine and New York with those states in lockdown.  But like many foreigner nationals married to Canadians but yet to become permanent residents, Yorinks was refused entry at the border. The couple have been separated for weeks now, one in Florida, the other in Nova Scotia, not knowing when the border will reopen.  “Adrienne was not on a shopping trip. It was not an optional travel. She’s travelling to our primary home with me, a Canadian,” said Aucoin, who met his now wife in 2014. They wed in 2018.  “The fact is Canadian families are being separated notwithstanding of our prime minister’s assertions.”  On March 16, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the border would be closed to non-Canadians, he made exceptions for immediate family members of Canadian citizens and permanent residents. The travel ban, as stated in the government’s orders, was to curtail the spread of COVID-19.  However, since April, a growing number of foreign spouses and children of Canadians have been refused admission into Canada because their travels are deemed “non-essential and optional” by Canadian border agents at airports and land border crossings, said lawyers.  “The Order-in-Council is very clear that immediate family members of a Canadian citizen or permanent resident are exempted from the travel restrictions,” said Barbara Jo Caruso, a former chair of the Canadian Bar Association’s immigration division.  “It appeared the border was open for a period of time, and then they started tightening it in early April. And now nobody gets in except if (the travel) is of essential nature.”  On Good Friday, after being on the road for hours driving back from Juno Beach, Fla., Aucoin, a retired lawyer, and Yorinks, an artist and author, arrived at the border crossing between Calais, Maine and Saint Stephen, N.B. at 5:30 a.m. A border agent refused to let Yorinks in because her travel was deemed non-essential.  When the couple returned to the United States border entry, American officials refused to let Aucoin in because Washington’s COVID-19 travel ban doesn’t have provisions to exempt foreign spouses accompanying Americans.  “It’s been a roller-coaster for us, and we have tried to keep our spirits up,” said Aucoin, who had consulted a lawyer, obtained a notarized statement from the Justice of Peace who married them in Cape Breton and drafted a quarantine plan upon arrival. Yorinks ended up having to drive home to their winter home in Florida by herself.  Immigration lawyer Rafeena Rashid, who used to represent the federal Justice Department and now has her own practice, said her clients — a British and Canadian couple — boarded a government repatriation flight to Toronto Pearson airport April 13 after Global Affairs Canada cleared them.  However, the border agency seized the British husband’s passport and sent him back to the U.K. the next day. The couple are still separated.  “It is very clear that one thing is said to the public while something else is done behind the scenes by CBSA,” said Rashid. “CBSA absolutely has no oversight. Zero. Who’s CBSA to come up with its own criteria that’s not based on the law?”  In response to the Star’s inquiry, the border agency referred to a provision in the government’s COVID travel orders that says: A foreign national, including a Canadian’s immediate family member, is banned from entry if they seek to enter for an optional or discretionary purpose, such as tourism, recreation or entertainment.  However, an internal instruction for front-line border agents obtained by the Star revealed that Canada Border Services Agency actually has set criteria beyond that.  Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...  The guidelines include, among other criteria, a ban against a “foreign national coming to Canada to temporarily reside with spouse or immediate family during the pandemic.”  The immigration department last week also posted on its website examples of what are deemed discretionary: visit family on vacation; spend time at a secondary residence; attend a funeral; and birth of a grandchild.  What is not discretionary, it says, is for people to spend the pandemic period with their Canadian family member to ensure each other’s health, safety and well-being. “It would be beneficial to all parties, as the reunification of family members is a key point of the Order in Council,” it notes. “This allows for families to be together during this difficult time.”  Lawyers said the border agency’s own rules go against the spirit of the government order.  “There’s a consistent reference to essential travels, and they don’t see keeping a family together in crisis as essential,” said lawyer Erin Simpson, who has filed a court challenge against a border agency decision to deny one of her client’s entry to Canada.  Nadia Drost of Toronto said her Italian journalist husband, Bruno Federico, was denied entry at Pearson airport on April 22 and sent back to New York City, where he had travelled for an assignment for a documentary about COVID-19. The two had already booked an Airbnb for his 14-day quarantine.  “It’s wrong that border officers are following secret guidelines that are different from what the public is privy to,” said the 42-year-old Toronto woman, also a journalist. “We need oversight of CBSA in the way they interpret the government order.

And it’s true, we do cover the First Lady a great deal.  But I do understand the complaints. Melania is not the office holder. She is not setting policy.  However, these are not normal times.  We are facing the most corrupt government in American history, and that corruption drips down to the East Wing as well.  One of the problems we have with Melania is that it appears she worked illegally when she came to the United States.   Melania said:  “I followed the law. I never thought to stay here without papers. I had a visa, I traveled every few months back to the country to Slovenia to stamp the visa. I came back, I applied for the green card, I applied for the citizenship later on after many years of green card. So I went by system, I went by the law. And you should do that, you should not just say let me stay here and whatever happens, happens.”  But Politico reported that a wealth of evidence—including the nude photos shoot that graced the cover of The New York Post—suggests that she was, in fact, an undocumented immigrant who worked in this country illegally.  Politico places her in the United States one year earlier than she has previously claimed, and says she may have been on a B-1 business visa, not an H-1B work visa—which means that she likely committed visa fraud and worked in the country illegally…  Of course, Trump’s illegal immigration rhetoric is largely about race and kicking brown people out of what Trump’s white voters think is a white country, not white super-models taking jobs away from other white super-models. But on the surface, at least, Donald Trump’s wife may be the exact kind of immigrant that he’s been railing against for almost 5 years.  Next, we get to the highly coveted “Einstein Visa” that Melania obtained to remain in the U.S.  Melania Trump obtained U.S. citizenship on a visa reserved for immigrants with “extraordinary ability” and “sustained national and international acclaim”, according to a report in the Washington Post.  Nicknamed the “Einstein Visa”, the EB-1 is in theory reserved for people who are highly acclaimed in their field – the government cites Pulitzer, Oscar, and Olympic winners as examples – as well as respected academic researchers and multinational executives.  Melania began applying for the visa in 2000, when she was Melania Knauss, a Slovenian model working in New York and dating Donald Trump. She was approved in 2001, one of just five people from Slovenia to win the coveted visa that year, according to the Post.  Now, in applying for the visa, she would have to detail her history, including her educational history.  It turns out that Melania has lied in the past about her education, and even lied under oath during a deposition.  First, Melania did eventually come clean about the fact that she is a college dropout. She was originally called out for lying about it during the Republican National Convention in 2016.  But according to a great find from the now defunct Racked, Melania lied under oath in 2013.  Melania was involved in a lawsuit for her failed skincare line.  UNDER OATH, Melania said she graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Architecture.  Now we must ask the question.  Did Melania lie on her immigration forms?  According to NOLO, lying to an immigration officer can have extreme consequences including permanent inadmissibility, deportability, and not being allowed to apply for U.S. citizenship.  If Melania did indeed lie on her forms and/or interview, that is a crime, and Melania should not be given American citizenship. Furthermore, through the chain migration her husband so vehemently hates, Melania’s parents and sister also became U.S. citizens.

Few albums have fulfilled their intended purpose faster. Future Nostalgia was meant to arrive today, until an online leak brought it forward to the first Friday of Britain’s coronavirus lockdown.  Lipa wasn’t sure it felt right to release it during the pandemic, but accurately concluded that her brilliant disco-wreathed anthems-in-waiting – the kind that transform kitchen tiles into a makeshift Studio 54 – might distract fans from the news.  At the very least, a day of radio interviews and unceasing congrats stopped the 24-year-old from stressing about when to take her government-sanctioned daily walk. We FaceTime in the early evening of Future Nostalgia’s premature birthday, Lipa at ease in a Christopher Kane “Techno Sexual” jumper, modish straw-on-tarmac hair tied up, saucer eyes unadorned. Like everyone, she has been self-isolating, eating chips and watching Tiger King. Unlike everyone, she is doing it in a plush Airbnb (her London flat flooded) with her model boyfriend Anwar Hadid (brother of models Gigi and Bella). Later, she will be conference-calling friends and family to “drink and dance through the phone”.  Even though I know I’ve worked really hard and I did so much of the work, the performances and behind the scenes  Although Lipa says today has felt like Christmas, it is still an anticlimactic arrival for an album that the British music industry has been banking on. Hers is the rare homegrown success not belonging to anyone named Sheeran or Adele, born from no-nonsense mega-pop in the vein of Britney and her idol Pink. In 2017, Lipa was the most-streamed female musician in the world. A year later, she became the first female solo artist to get five Brits nominations (she won two), and the youngest woman to break 1 billion YouTube views with her video for New Rules, the single that transformed her from pop journeywoman to superstar. This January, it hit 2 billion.  Success creates freedom and pressure, says Lipa. At 11 tracks, the focused Future Nostalgia bucks pop’s trend for bloated, spread-betting albums that try to please all-comers. But her initial intention for the record – to have fun and ignore the world – came after online criticism threatened to dent her self-worth. “People almost made me feel bad about my achievements, or didn’t allow me to feel proud of the things that I’ve done because they made me feel like I was almost unworthy of them,” she says. “Even though I know I’ve worked really hard and I did so much of the work, the performances and behind the scenes.”  There are two key words here, the first being “almost“: Lipa is indomitable, not given to vulnerability, or at least not to showing it. The second is “work“: Lipa’s parents are Kosovar and Bosnian Muslim immigrants who fled war-torn Kosovo for the UK in 1992. She was born in 1995, and lived in London until the family returned to Pristina when she was 10.  At 15, she came back to pursue pop stardom, persuading her parents she would have a better chance of getting into a British university if she finished school here. Where most kids would go wild, Lipa grafted, pestered people with her demos and became an assiduous networker (the Instagram page for Girls Collective, a DIY talent agency she started with five friends, is still live). One connection led to another and she signed first with Lana Del Rey’s management team, then to Warner Music.  Reflecting pop’s long game, Lipa won the Grammy for best new artist in 2019. The backlash took flight  It took two years from releasing her debut single, Hotter Than Hell – showing off her trademark bungee-jump vocals and ex-vanquishing MO – to her first album. The latter was repeatedly delayed, Lipa a prime study of how pop careers build slowly and evolve publicly in the streaming era – and living proof of the “adaptability” she admired in her parents. “With every song, the momentum was building, but only tiny little bits,” she says. “I was doing new things, I was learning what was expected of me, how to be in front of a camera, how to better the last performance.”  But her singles were not charting well. By the time she released two successive collaborations – modern pop’s stabilisers – fans worried she was destined for pop’s dumper. Then she unleashed the video to New Rules, “and it was like rocket fuel”, she says, a feminist sleepover fever dream and instant classic. It takes place in a luxury Miami Beach hotel, which she approached to fund the video, not because her label had shut its wallet, but in a savvy cash grab that let her “push it to another level”. She never doubted her career prospects. “I just didn’t think it was gonna happen like this.”  Reflecting pop’s long game, Lipa won the Grammy for best new artist in 2019. The backlash took flight. “People being like: ‘She’s been fucking best new artist for so long and she doesn’t deserve that, blah blah blah,‘” she recalls. “There were times that I felt people were being so mean that when someone recognised me and said: ‘I really like your music,‘ I’d be like: ‘Oh my God, not everyone hates me!’” She says this with self-aware melodrama, though it echoes recent sentiments from Billie Eilish and Britney Spears: how dismal it must feel to see your hard work burned up by hatred.  Lipa hopes the #BeKind movement sparked by Caroline Flack’s death might improve online discourse. “The scrutiny not just on social media but in the media, especially towards women, is so intense and unkind and really trying to get a rise out of people,” she says. “The tabloids know very well what they’re doing, and it really affects everyone. You have to be made out of steel to not let words get to you. It’s so sad that we have to learn lessons from somebody’s death.”  But then, maybe we are a long way off when, as Lipa says, “certain leaders are inciting racism and almost making it acceptable for people to be racist and treating people in very vile and disgusting ways”. British political parties are “absolutely” sowing such division, she says. “You have people like Nigel Farage, who is very openly racist and that is just shocking, and there are people who beat around the bush. They’re racist but – it’s such a mindfuck – they have a lot of people fooled.”  The scrutiny not just on social media but in the media, especially towards women, is so intense and unkind.  Dua Lipa: ‘I really wanted to make sure there wasn’t any tracks you could skip’  Lipa is unusually specific about politics for a pop star of her stature. It’s not just “vote”, it’s “vote Labour”, or “vote Bernie”, or “FUCK THE PATRIARCHY I AM DONE WITH THIS BULLSHIT HANDMAIDS TALE SHIT WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK” after Alabama banned abortion. She credits her parents for her voice, saying she was raised “really liberal”. She is most concerned about UK immigration policy post-Brexit. Had it existed in the 90s, she thinks it would have stopped the Lipas fleeing Kosovo (where her mum was a lawyer, her dad a dentist-in-training) for the UK, where they worked as waiters and studied for new careers.  “It upsets me that probably some of the younger generations of refugees don’t really have the same opportunities that I was given because of the fortunate – or unfortunate – fact that my parents moved to London and I was born here and able to live my dream and do something on a global scale,” she says. Whether post-Brexit Britain still offers those opportunities, “we’re gonna have to see how everything works out”, she says cautiously. Brexit has been upsetting: “Being from Kosovo, I know what it would mean for them to be a part of the EU and be accepted.”  It is an obvious thing to say about someone who frequently entertains packed arenas, but Lipa evidently wants to be heard. Although she occasionally jumps into the conversational deep end but grips the safety rail (a devout Labour supporter, she indicates that she is no Corbyn fan, but won’t say so outright), she sticks to her chosen guns. She kept Future Nostalgia relatively short to hold listeners’ attention spans. “I really wanted to make sure there wasn’t any tracks you could skip,” she grins.  Pop’s detractors like to point out that it is an industry where artists conform to conventions. In the immortal words of Eilish: duh. Lipa is a canny operator who understood that she had to play a certain game to reach the point where she could be herself. (Her ambition/achievement conversion rate is a big part of her aspirational appeal.) Lipa was surprised by the under-recognition of female talent at this year’s Brits – evidence, critics said, of the British industry’s inability to develop female talent – but she is pragmatic about what might seem like a conservative feeder system where new acts spew out singles and accept every possible collaboration. “Artists that are already well known get the upper hand, so you do have to get on those playlists as much as possible to be heard,” she says.  Women’s work is always undermined, says Lipa. “We all have to work a little bit harder to be taken seriously  Following Lipa’s success, one such feeder system seemed to be getting young female acts to make their version of New Rules: Mabel’s Don’t Call Me Up, Ella Eyre’s New Me and Anne-Marie’s Friends to name just three. (Incidentally, New Rules is the only one of Lipa’s songs that she hasn’t had a hand in writing.) She must have noticed. “Er, have I noticed ...? I don’t know if I’ve noticed ...” she says, her game face dropping to reveal that she has absolutely noticed. “But that’s OK, though!” she says when called on it. “There’s lots of different ways to say the same thing, make it honest and unique to you.” She resists the idea that anyone is being told to recreate someone else’s success.  Had Lipa tried to recreate New Rules for album two, “I’d just be in a vicious cycle”, she says. She says she struggled to find her “lyrical language” on her debut, feeling more at ease writing sad songs. “I learned that I could write happy songs that are still really authentic and have the possibility of being cool and not seen as bubblegum.” Most striking is how she sings about sex: mutually pleasurable, orgasmic transcendence mirrored in dazzling disco reveries. On Good in Bed, she nonchalantly celebrates “all that good pipe in the moonlight” from a toxic ex-with-benefits. “Everybody thinks that as a woman, you have to be so careful about how you portray yourself or how you talk about sex, and everything has to be really sweet,” she says mockingly. “It’s just very colloquial and how I chat with my mates.”  I don’t like to apologise if I don’t believe I should be apologising for something  Future Nostalgia ends with its lone ballad, the weighty Boys Will Be Boys, where a children’s choir backs Lipa singing about how girls grow up faster in a world of male violence. She wanted to make something that felt like the moment the lights go on at the end of a party, “so it would almost end a bit abruptly and maybe make you feel uncomfortable”. She has grown less accommodating, a dynamic she dealt with in real life in January, when she attended Lizzo’s Grammys afterparty at an LA strip club. After they were filmed throwing money at dancers with Rosalía, Lipa was accused of exploiting women, sparking the hashtag #dualipaisoverparty where users revelled in her “cancellation”.  Lipa – who no longer goes on Twitter – did not respond. “I don’t like to apologise if I don’t believe I should be apologising for something,” she says now. “I believe in supporting women in all fields of work. Nothing at that party was derogatory; everyone was just dancing and having fun.” In our supposedly enlightened culture about sex work, she was surprised by the prudish response. “That’s something we all have to work on,” she says. “Not every sex worker is being forced to do something they don’t wanna do. I think a lot of the women found it really empowering and really like to dance.”  Women’s work is always undermined, says Lipa. “We all have to work a little bit harder to be taken seriously, but it’s not something that we’re not used to doing,” she says, rolling her eyes and grinning. She has pointedly described Future Nostalgia as “fun” even though she knows that is exactly the stick critics use to beat it with; that women in pop are only judged as “authentic” when they are weeping by the piano. “Time always tells,” she shrugs. “And in the meantime, I’ll just work for people to take me seriously.” – Guardian  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 34, "joy": 10, "negative": 15, "sadness": 2, "disgust": 4, "positive": 42, "anger": 24, "surprise": 6, "fear": 6, "trust": 7}, "metadata": ["online", "coronavirus", "distract", "british", "youtube", "freedom", "focused", "muslim", "uk", "university", "repeatedly", "sparked", "media", "racism", "racist", "treating", "immigration", "fleeing", "global", "brexit", "eu", "conservative", "dropping", "twitter", "rolling"]}, {"text": "Community health centers had been at the front lines of health care in the nation's poorest neighborhoods even before the spread of the coronavirus. But in the midst of the pandemic, patients who fear deportation or infection are forcing many centers to close.  Public health officials worry that the populations that these centers serve — mostly people with low incomes and immigrants — aren't getting proper health care and testing, may be unable to quarantine themselves and could contribute to spreading the coronavirus to the wider population.  \"People are worried about COVID-19,\" says Joslyn Pettway, acting CEO of in Detroit, a nonprofit health center. \"If patients don't come in for a visit, we lose money.\"  Covenant serves more than 20,000 patients each year through five locations with a staff of about 200. Pettway was forced to furlough about 50 staff members and shut down two full-service dental centers, because dental care is not essential, even though 1,400 patients are on a waiting list.  The lack of patients seeking health care is a direct result of Michigan's tough battle against the coronavirus. As of May 18, the state had more than 51,000 confirmed cases, with Detroit registering more than 10,000 confirmed cases and 1,255 deaths, according to Michigan state health data.  \"Our patient population has been hard hit, no doubt about it,\" Pettway says. \"Those health disparities that we've seen due to COVID, they existed long before COVID. COVID just brought it to light.\"  / Courtesy of Covenant Community Care Joslyn Pettway is acting CEO of Covenant Community Care in Detroit. So far Covenant has tested at least 244 patients for the coronavirus, and it is planning to open a drive-in testing site.  There's no better time to argue for affordable access to care for everyone, she adds. The coronavirus pandemic shows why we need to keep pushing to expand access to medical care for everybody, regardless of the person's status, Pettway says.  \"Nobody is excluded from the impact of COVID. And so people who are unable to access care for a variety of reasons, they increase the spread of the virus,\" ultimately impacting all of us, she says.  Community health centers, like Covenant Community Care, were launched in 1965 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Office of Economic Opportunity, propelled by the civil rights movement and the War on Poverty. Their aim then, as it is now, is to provide comprehensive and affordable primary care to medically underserved populations, regardless of their insurance or immigration status and their ability to pay for services.  Pettway says it's not atypical for Covenant patients to delay care, especially preventive care. To many low-income residents, preventive health care is a luxury. They either can't take the time away from work or lack transportation or child care.  \"They were already struggling before the pandemic,\" she says.  Covenant has been hit hard by the pandemic. Only one site is open for in-person urgent visits, such as testing for the coronavirus, newborn checkups or an abscess that needs to be drained. The other four locations are currently serving patients virtually.  Using $997,490 from the federal CARES Act, Pettway invested in telehealth software in March to keep the Covenant centers running.  \"We are working very hard not to shut down locations,\" she says. \"The need is massive in Detroit.\"  / Sage Davis Family nurse practitioner Sage Davis set up the telehealth program for Covenant Community Care.  Before the coronavirus, Sage Davis, a family nurse practitioner at Covenant, relied heavily on the full panel of a patient's vital signs, lab work and physical exam. Now she doesn't have that information to make decisions about a patient's treatment.  Davis is making different calculations, along with her patients.  \"What's the risk of possible exposure going to medical facilities? And then, what's the risk if we don't get lab work right now or we don't get this imaging right now?\" she asks. \"It takes a lot of clinical judgment to determine if this is something that we really do need to get right now or if it's something that can wait. We really are looking at the patient in front of us and just treating our patient.\"  Davis, who is managing the center's transition to telehealth, says she constantly reminds her patients to call back if things get worse or change. A decision made today gets reviewed and assessed, she says.  \"I do have options for sending people to an in-person visit if they need it,\" and that gives Davis peace of mind.  One of the silver linings of telehealth, Davis says, is that before COVID-19, patients stepped out of their environment to come into the center for care.  \"Now we're in their environment in a way,\" which Davis says is helpful.  For example, let's say a patient with diabetes and joint problems walks up the stairs slowly and unsteadily to get a thermometer.  \"I can see in the video the amount of time and effort it takes her to climb that set of stairs,\" she says. \"Whereas in my office, I'm cognizant of her joint problem, but I don't see her climbing stairs.\"  Around the U.S., 1,400 health center organizations across 14,000 locations in rural and urban areas serve more than 29 million people, most of whom are low income, are uninsured or on Medicaid and Medicare, or are immigrants, according to the National Association of Community Health Centers. Almost 2,000 sites have shut down since the pandemic hit.  \"Financially, these centers are getting a blow in this pandemic,\" says Dr. Ron Yee, chief medical officer for the National Association of Community Health Centers.  \"When you cut your visits by half, that's going to change your revenue, even though you may make up for it a little bit with virtual visits,\" Yee says.  / Juan Gallegos Dr. Edgar Chavez of Universal Community Health Center in Los Angeles says that it's scary to see people relax social distancing rules. \"Just because the government says you can open, you can go back to work, doesn't mean the virus has disappeared,\" he says. \"The virus is still around and can infect people.\"  Virtual visits don't get reimbursed at the same rate as regular in-person visits. For example, he says, an online visit is currently being reimbursed at between $13 and $93, while community health centers receive between $100 and $150 in reimbursement for an in-person appointment.  But it's not only the coronavirus crisis that concerns Yee. Community health centers operate on short-term funding, and it expires on Nov. 30, unless Congress acts.  \"I'm very worried about the future of our centers,\" Yee says.  And doctors and nurses are struggling in this crisis.  \"Right now health centers are projected to lose about $7.6 billion between April and September to get through this, to stay whole so that we can be up and running when we get through this pandemic,\" he says, adding that this projection is based on a 60% decline in visits systemwide.  Community health centers are playing a vital role in this pandemic. As of May 1, more than 300,000 patients had been tested for the coronavirus.  In California, a large number of patients at community health centers are recent immigrants, says Dr. Edgar Chavez, who serves as medical director at Universal Community Health Center, a cluster of three centers in South Los Angeles.  Chavez says patients fear that being tested for the coronavirus will land them on a list to be deported. This mistrust of the government and reluctance to seek medical care stem from the Trump administration's public charge rule, Chavez says.  Chaves is working virtually, and his staff is calling patients and checking in on them for depression and anxiety as well as to see if they need to be tested for anything.  \"Telehealth can only go so far with chronic care. You still need that lab data point,\" he says with a sigh. \"We are going to have a lot of people that go without Pap smears, go without mammograms, go without all these different things that we use to improve and maintain their health.\"  Chavez says he worries about the health of his patients.  \"People aren't eating well. They are not exercising, and they are anxious,\" he says. \"I fear that we are going to be hit with a huge wave of uncontrolled patients with chronic care-related conditions, especially diabetes, hypertension and heart disease.\"   Chavez's voice trails off.  \"It is very tough,\" he says. \"We're doing the best that we can, but we're going to be facing a pretty, pretty tough situation.\"  The need was already massive before this public health crisis hit and it will get worse after the pandemic is over, health care providers say.

Four years later, after facing controversies surrounding its’ leadership and criticism over the focus of the march, the expected number of attendees for the fourth annual Women’s March, which will take place on Saturday morning, has lessened. But, does the Women’s March still matter to Black women?  MORE: Women’s March Did Not Cut Ties With Tamika Mallory. Here’s The Real Story  According to the Independent Women’s Forum, the focuses of this year’s march are reproductive rights, climate change and immigration. And while these concerns are important, they don’t particularly tap into the issues troubling Black women.  IWF said that two major concerns for Black women are safety and income. “Criminal justice and policing reform and affordable healthcare top their issues of concern at 48 percent and 47 percent, respectively. Equal rights and equal pay come in a strong third place (42 percent) tied with hate crimes. Affordable housing and college costs round out the top five,” according to IWF.  The forum added that the Women’s March should shift its’ focus to entrepreneurship, which “ranks high among black women.”  Despite the notion that the march doesn’t necessarily appeal to Black women, 28-year-old Icy Coomber, who attended a poster-making session in preparation for the Women’s March to be held in Washington, D.C. on Saturday, feels that not attending the march is counterproductive, according to NPR.  “When we’re talking about women’s rights, I feel like black women or women of color are usually left out of that conversation,” Coomber said. “But I think not going, not representing people like me, doesn’t help anything. I’m trying to have a change of heart.”  Jocelyn Harmon, co-founder of BlackHer – a media platform that champions Black women, their voices and educates them on political and economic change, spoke to NewsOne about why the Women’s March is still prevalent to Black women. “My gut says yes – I think the march absolutely matters because I think there’s absolutely power in numbers. And I think that women – Black women, and white women, and native women, and folks who identify as women – I think we absolutely have things in common. I think there’s absolutely a place, whether it’s the women’s march or other coalition building activities where we absolutely should come together and need to come together around shared interests,” she explained.  Harmon, whose organization is a partner of the 2020 Women’s March, noted that the interests of Black and white women diverge due to racism.  The BlackHer co-founder also spoke to the importance of intersectionality, which is affected by the aforementioned divergence of women. “How do we learn to understand our commonalities, but also how do we not just erase our differences?” she said. “Part of what BlackHer is trying to say is, yes there’s a time and a place for us to come together under this header of women and celebrate together and challenge structures together. At the same time, it’s really important to have a space where we’re just centering Black women.”  Harmon added, “It really matters who’s in the center of your story. If you tell a story about women, your narrative or your arc is going to go one way, but if you tell a story about Black women it’s going to go a different way – and that’s because of racism in our country.”  Last year, The Washington Post reported that the march parted ways with three of its’ founding members – Tamika Mallory, Bob Bland, and Linda Sarsour. Reports alleged that the women stepped down due to anti-Semitism accusations. It was also said that the women were replaced due to the election of three new members as the board of directors. However, that information was proven to be incorrect.  By-laws for the Women’s March indicate that the three women were serving two-year terms as directors and their terms expired, which meant new directors had to be elected. One of the directors, however, had to be a co-chair of the 2017 Women’s March on Washington. Thus, Carmen Perez – the founding member, maintained her position as she was one of the co-chairs of the 2017 march.  Perez spoke to The Atlantic and expressed that the march is inclusive. “I believe that the Women’s March is a space for all women. When women feel a desire to participate in the Women’s March, they may not agree with every piece of the ideology, they may not agree with the whole feminist platform, but I’m sure there’s something that they do agree with. I believe that the Women’s March is for you. The Women’s March is a place for people who identify as women, whether you’re trans or you’re a person who has always been a woman. The unity principles were an entry point for people to get involved,” she said.

The expansive view of presidential authority has been promoted by John Yoo, a Berkeley Law professor known for writing the so-called 'torture memos' that the George W. Bush administration used to justify using 'enhanced interrogation' techniques after the 9/11 terror attacks.  Yoo told The Associated Press on Thursday that he has had multiple conversations with senior administration officials in which he has made the case that a June Supreme Court ruling that rejected Trump's effort to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , or DACA, opened the door to enormous new presidential power.  'I said, 'Why not just take the DACA opinion itself and do a search-replace. And every time it says 'DACA' ... replace it with 'skills-based immigration system,'\" Yoo said he told the White House. 'This gives President Trump an alternative to create such a program, at least for a few years.\"  Not long after the conversations, Trump began promising a series of new executive orders on a range of issues.  'The decision by the Supreme Court on DACA allows me to do things on immigration, on health care, on other things that we've never done before,\" Trump said in an interview on Fox News Sunday, predicting \"a very exciting two weeks.\"  The court concluded in its 5-4 decision that the Trump administration did not take the proper steps to end DACA. The program was created by former President Barack Obama and provided legal protections to some 650,000 immigrants brought to the country as children.  Chief Justice John Roberts' opinion castigated the administration for cutting legal corners, finding its conduct 'arbitrary and capricious' under a 1946 federal law that guides how agencies develop regulations and policies.  Roberts, joined by the court's four liberals justices, notably did not conclude one way or the other whether DACA is legal. But Yoo has made the case in several articles that the court, in its ruling, invalidated one of the main checks on presidential power: the ability of new presidents to immediately undo executive action enacted by their predecessors.  Under the court's decision, he wrote in Newsweek, 'presidents can now stop enforcing laws they dislike, hand out permits or benefits that run contrary to acts of Congress and prevent their successors from repealing their policies for several years.'  In National Review, Yoo suggested Trump could, for instance, now create a nationwide right to carry guns openly by refusing to enforce federal firearms laws and then creating a new 'Trump permit' that would free any holder of local gun restrictions.  Liberal legal scholars said Yoo, who served as deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel under Bush, was wildly off-base and reading far too much into a decision that focused on the administration's sloppiness.  But Yoo said that soon after publication of the articles, he received a call from White House officials he declined to name. 'I wasn't expecting to get a call. I wasn't trying to influence the White House,' he said, noting his articles were intended to criticize what he thought the court had gotten wrong.  Nonetheless, he shared his opinion with the White House that the decision gives Trump the power to reorient American immigration policy 'toward one that is focused on merit, skills and assets,\" as Trump favors, without having to reach a deal with Congress, which has rejected such measures.  And Yoo argued the same reasoning could apply in other areas, such as healthcare, giving Trump the ability, for instance, to stop spending federal resources to enforce an employer contraceptive mandate.  Several White House officials stressed that while Yoo's writings have been spotted around the West Wing, his opinions only reinforced discussions that already were taking place.  Indeed, Trump and members of his administration extending back to former White House Counsel Don McGahn have long held expansive views of presidential powers. Trump has repeatedly asserted new authority in executive orders and flouted congressional oversight efforts, from redirecting funds appropriated by Congress to asserting broad privilege to ignore subpoenas.  'When somebody is the President of the United States, the authority is total,' he declared in April.  Trump, in his interview with Fox, seemed eager to flex the new powers he claimed the DACA decision had granted \" though it remains unclear whether he will follow through.  'We're signing a health care plan within two weeks, a full and complete health care plan that the Supreme Court decision on DACA gave me the right to do,\" he asserted. 'The Supreme Court gave the president of the United States powers that nobody thought the president had, by approving, by doing what they did.'  Critics called Yoo's ideas disingenuous and unconstitutional.  Victoria Nourse, a Georgetown University law professor, said, 'Yoo's track record should warn you that he is given to claims that are out of the mainstream.\"  Yoo is relying on a false premise: that the court upheld Obama's creation of the DACA program in the first place, said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas.  \"To call it an embarrassing analysis is to dramatically understate just how nefarious it is,' Vladeck wrote in an email.  On Twitter, Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe wrote that Yoo's take on the DACA decision 'is a wildly irresponsible and, of course, unconstitutional 'reading' of\" the decision.  Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, said Yoo's take was at best \"a badly mistaken reading of what the court did. At worst, it's a willful twisting of the court's words.'  During the Bush administration, Yoo wrote a 2001 memo advising that the military could use 'any means necessary' to hold terror suspects. In a 2002 memo, he advised that treatment of suspected terrorists was torture only if it caused pain levels equivalent to 'organ failure, impairment of bodily function or even death.' Yoo also advised that the president might have the constitutional power to allow torturing enemy combatants.   ___  Associated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed to this report.

The questions go right to the top: Prime Minister Scott Morrison was asked whether his government had representations from Maguire about visas. He did not deny it, saying he received a lot of representations, “including on those which the member has referred to”. The PM was then asked about evidence given by the AFP in estimates today, indicating that it would engage with the NSW ICAC on whether Maguire was involved with the Leppington deal. Deputy Prime Minister and Infrastructure Minister Michael McCormack endured a barrage of questions from Labor’s shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, asking whether he still considered the Leppington deal a “bargain”, as he did in September. McCormack dissembled – admitting that the land was purchased for more than it was worth and was subject to police investigation – but said it was still a good thing that the purchase was going ahead since it would enable the development of Western Sydney Airport. “It will cost a lot more in the future,” McCormack said, in a feeble defence of the indefensible. Once again, the stench begs the question: where is the government up to with a federal integrity commission? Attorney-General Christian Porter today gave a detailed, but inadequate, answer to that question.  It is not so surprising that the deep corruption exposed by the ICAC investigation into Daryl Maguire – who was, until recently, the long-time partner of the state premier, Gladys Berejiklian – might have federal implications. Maguire’s whole business model was blatantly corrupt (he’s admitted to “monetising” his position as an MP), and it would be surprising if he did not try every angle with every political connection he could muster, including in Canberra. It would make sense if those connections were strongest with federal Coalition MPs based in NSW, including Morrison (a former immigration minister) and McCormack, whose electoral office is in Wagga Wagga.  Maguire was already known to be angling for a sales commission on a land property deal near Western Sydney Airport on behalf of landowner Louise Waterhouse, who he once met in the lobby of Berejiklian’s office. Auditor-General Grant Hehir told Senate estimates that he had referred the Leppington purchase to the federal police – the first time he had done so in his five years at the Australian National Audit Office. The AFP’s deputy commissioner, Ian McCartney, told Senate estimates earlier today that police would be engaging with ICAC on both the Leppington deal – to see whether Maguire had any role – and the cash-for-visas scheme.  Meanwhile, as the NSW probity hearings continue into whether Crown is fit to hold a gaming licence at its new Sydney casino, former Howard-era communications minister and Crown Resorts chair Helen Coonan has conceded the company facilitated money laundering at its Melbourne casino. Yet when Wilkie moved for a suspension of standing orders to debate a proposed royal commission into Crown, both government and the Opposition opposed it. “Government and Opposition partially-owned subsidiaries of the gambling industry QED,” tweeted senior journalist, commentator and academic Tony Walker.  So where the bloody hell is our federal ICAC? Independent MP Helen Haines asked the attorney-general today why there was such a lengthy delay in legislating a robust integrity commission, “when scandals like the Western Sydney Airport demand action on integrity, now”. Porter answered the question respectfully, and in detail, explaining that it was not appropriate to bring on the legislation while Victoria was in the middle of a second wave of COVID-19, and that the beefed-up Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity – which got a funding boost in the budget – would be operating from January 1. He also discussed the Coalition’s model for the new ICAC in more detail than he has lately:  We’ve been very clear what our model for the integrity commission would look like. We’ve said quite clearly there’d be two divisions. There’d be a law-enforcement integrity division. There’d be a public-sector integrity division. Each of those divisions would have powers greater than a royal commission. The law-enforcement division would maintain discretionary capacity to conduct public hearings. The public-sector division would run compulsory private hearings to investigate matters and build a brief to form the basis of a prosecution. Each division would have its own powers. Both divisions would have powers to investigate a broad, existing suite of public sector offences. They could look at past conduct in that regard. The new commission would also be empowered to investigate with respect to newly created offences as well as existing ones. But the government’s view, not one shared universally, is there could not be retrospective application of new criminal laws or new standards of corruption.  It’s not good enough, but it at least shows that the government has made some progress with its bill. Now it just has to introduce it. Absolutely ASAP.

It's true that, since George Floyd died, the protests have never quite ended, but in all these weeks what's generally been protested might be called the war at home. (After all, according to a recent New York Times report, Floyd was only one of 70 Americans who, in the last decade, said \"I can't breathe\" before dying in police custody.) Still, it remains striking that America's so-called war on terror -- a series of conflicts that has extended from the Philippines and Afghanistan across the Greater Middle East and ever deeper into Africa -- has remained largely unprotested here at home since it began almost 19 years ago.  There are undoubtedly many reasons for this, but one, recently highlighted in a study by Heidi Peltier at Brown University's invaluable Costs of War Project, is the way so much of American war-making in these years has been fobbed off on private contractors, now responsible for $370 billion (or more than half) of the Pentagon budget, and on those they hire -- in that way \"concealing the true financial and human costs of America's post-9-11 wars.\" It's not just the literal weaponry of war that's been so privatized (with soaring costs) but even the \"warriors\" or at least those supporting them in the war zones. In 2019, for instance, stationed in the Middle East were 53,000 private contractors hired by U.S. companies and only 35,000 American troops. Similarly, since 2001, 8,000 contractors have died in that region (or 1,000 more than American troop deaths there). Many of them, by the way, were hired foreign nationals, so their deaths went completely unattended to here.  In other words, what Peltier calls the \"commercialization\" of war has helped make Washington's forever wars so much less noticeable in this country where the American taxpayer has funded them all these years (to the detriment of everything from domestic infrastructure to preparations for possible pandemics).  Today, Pentagon expert and TomDispatch regular William Hartung considers how that increasingly privatized and corrupt military has been coming home and just how well it's meshed with, and supported, both the American system of policing and imprisonment (itself being privatized) on a scale unmatched elsewhere on this planet. It should be a scandal and a half. Tom  Police, Prisons, and the Pentagon  Defunding America's Wars at Home and Abroad  By William D. Hartung Think of it as a war system that's been coming home for years. The murder of George Floyd has finally shone a spotlight on the need to defund local police departments and find alternatives that provide more genuine safety and security. The same sort of spotlight needs soon to be shone on the American military machine and the wildly well-funded damage it's been doing for almost 19 years across the Greater Middle East and Africa. Distorted funding priorities aren't the only driving force behind police violence against communities of color, but shifting such resources away from policing and to areas like jobs, education, housing, and restorative justice could be an important part of the solution. And any effort to boost spending on social programs should include massive cuts to the Pentagon's bloated budget. In short, it's time to defund our wars, both at home and abroad. The High Cost of Police and Prisons In most states and localities, spending on police and prisons outweighs what the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., once described as \"programs of social uplift.\" The numbers are staggering. In some jurisdictions, police alone can account for up to 40% of local budgets, leaving little room for other priorities. In New York City, for instance, funding the police department's operations and compensation costs more than $10 billion yearly -- more, that is, than the federal government spends on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nationwide, more than $100 billion annually goes into policing. Now, add to that another figure: what it costs to hold roughly two million (yes 2,000,000!) Americans in prisons and jails -- roughly $120 billion a year. Like policing, in other words, incarceration is big business in this country in 2020. After all, prison populations have grown by nearly 700% since 1972, driven in significant part by the \"war on drugs,\" a so-called war that has disproportionately targeted people of color. The Elephant in the Room: Pentagon Spending In addition to the police and prisons, the other major source of American militarized spending is, of course, the Pentagon. That department, along with related activities like nuclear weapons funding at the Department of Energy, now gobbles up at least $750 billion per year. That's more than the military budgets of the next 10 countries combined. Just as prisons and policing consume a startling proportion of state and local budgets, the Pentagon accounts for more than half of the federal government's discretionary budget and that includes most government functions other than Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. As Ashik Siddique of the National Priorities Project has noted, the Trump administration's latest budget proposal \"prioritizes brute force and militarization over diplomatic and humanitarian solutions to pressing societal crises\" in a particularly striking way. \"Just about every non-militarized department funded by the discretionary budget,\" he adds, \"is on the chopping block, including all those that focus on reducing poverty and meeting human needs like education, housing, labor, health, energy, and transportation.\" Spending on the militarization of the U.S.-Mexico border and the deportation of immigrants through agencies like ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) and Customs and Border Protection totals another $24 billion annually. That puts U.S. spending on police, prisons, and the Pentagon at nearly $1 trillion per year and that doesn't even include the soaring budgets of other parts of the American national security state like the Department of Homeland Security ($92 billion) and the Veterans Administration ($243 billion -- a cost of past wars). Back in May 2019, Mandy Smithberger of the Project on Government Oversight and I had already estimated that the full national security budget, including the Pentagon, was approximately $1.25 trillion a year and that estimate, of course, didn't even include the police and the prison system! Another way of looking at the problem is to focus on just how much of the federal budget goes to the Pentagon and other militarized activities, including federal prisons, immigration enforcement, and veterans benefits. An analysis by the National Priorities Project at the Institute for Policy Studies puts this figure at $887 billion, or more than 64% of the federal discretionary budget including public health, education, environmental protection, job training, energy development, housing, transportation, scientific research, and more.

Although we are making progress on clean energy solutions, emissions have continued to rise. We are now almost out of time to reduce emissions fast enough for a chance at avoiding the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. This election could be our final opportunity to elect leaders who will take the action required.  Of course, there are other lasting consequences of the choices we make in this election, but none with the potential to impact all life on the entire planet for at least hundreds of years to come. For this reason, I am focusing on climate as the top issue, followed by every other issue that climate change impacts: the economy, health care, jobs, immigration, education, gun violence, racism, poverty … all elements of human civilization depend upon a habitable planet.  Quite simply, we must elect Democrats. The other party, if it can even be called the Republican Party anymore, has demonstrated a near total inability to acknowledge the reality of climate science, or indeed almost any kind of science – or fact-based version of reality.  A political party that cannot even agree on the merits of wearing a mask during a pandemic, killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, has no business anywhere near a position of power. We must remove these dangerous people from office before first our democracy, and then our planet, is left in ruins.  Along with electing Democrats, in Boulder we will vote on another ballot measure related to climate change: a partnership with Xcel Energy. This partnership is the most effective and affordable path forward for our city to decarbonize as rapidly as possible.  Considering that climate change is such a time-sensitive issue, it is shameful that we have taken the last 10 years, not to mention around $30 million dollars, to only get as far as we have. Meanwhile, Xcel Energy has become the first investor-owned utility in the country to commit to 100 percent zero emissions electricity by 2050, a crisis-relevant time frame that climate science tells us is required.  Getting to 100 percent zero emissions electricity will involve significant technical expertise, as the integration of distributed renewable energy and battery storage is a complicated engineering challenge. Along with distributed renewables and batteries, the grid will need to support millions of electric vehicles and smart electric appliances, and even green hydrogen production as we aim to decarbonize all sectors of the economy, from mobility to buildings and industry.  As the electric utility industry goes through this dramatic evolution, having an experienced partner operating the grid and evaluating cost-effective clean energy solutions will be critical for maintaining reliable, safe, and affordable service. Working with such a partner, Boulder can continue pushing to go further faster.  We are fortunate that after all this time and money spent trying to take ownership of old poles and wires and gain local control of our emissions, Xcel Energy is still willing to offer us a partnership that meets most, if not all, of the criteria we requested. If we do not accept this offer, the city will be in the unenviable position of trying to buy those old poles and wires and operate a brand new utility, during a period of multiple challenges: not just an increasingly complex technical environment, but also a budgetary crisis caused by the pandemic.  The city frankly does not have the money now to undertake the formation of a municipal utility. I suppose it would be interesting to see what the City Council does if this ballot measure fails, but I also am a Boulder native who would prefer to see the city succeed in both not going bankrupt and reducing emissions.  If you are feeling more comfortable about voting for Democrats than voting for this partnership, I ask you to go back to the beginning of this column. The most important thing is reducing emissions, immediately.  Both electing Democrats and forming this partnership are critical to this effort. It is far less important if your energy bill comes from Xcel or the city. It is far less important if you think that companies are somehow inherently less trustworthy than governments. Going back to the earlier point about the importance of electing Democrats, there are many examples showing that governments can be untrustworthy.  If you care about the climate crisis, vote for Democrats, and vote for the partnership with Xcel Energy. This is our last chance.  Beth Hartman is a Boulder native who has focused on clean energy research and innovation for more than a decade.

Visa officers were also directed to stop so-called birth tourism, or trips taken by pregnant women to obtain citizenship for their children.  “The State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor (B-1/B-2) visas to aliens seeking to enter the United States for birth tourism...this rule change is necessary to enhance public safety, national security and the integrity of our immigration system,” a statement from Stephanie Grisham, who is the White House Press Secretary, read.   What is birth tourism?  Birth tourism is the practice where pregnant women travel to the United States to secure automatic and permanent American citizenship for their children by giving birth on American soil.  It’s a practice perpetrated by citizens of most countries; and US President Donald Trump, who was propelled to the presidency in 2016 on the back of an anti-immigrant sentiment, wants to put an end to it all.  Conservatives in the U.S have long railed against what they call “anchor babies.”  Anchor babies are children born on American soil and used by their parents to bring in other family members to the U.S.  Trump has also criticized the constitutional provision that grants U.S citizenship to most babies born in the United States, the New York Times (NYT) writes.  Why is this suddenly a problem for the U.S?  Grisham says the new rule aims to stop those who seek “automatic and permanent American citizenship for their children by giving birth on American soil.  “It will also defend American taxpayers from having their hard-earned dollars siphoned away to finance the direct and downstream costs associated with birth tourism.\"  She adds that, “The integrity of American citizenship must be protected.”  Stephanie Grisham is White House Press Secretary (Evening Standard)  Carl C. Risch, Assistant Secretary of State for consular affairs, says “the birth tourism industry is also rife with criminal activity, including international criminal schemes.”  For the Trump administration, banning birth tourism is another way of enhancing national security, tackling terrorism and making America safe again, even though there is no empirical nexus between anchor babies and terrorist attacks or gun violence on U.S soil.  How will U.S embassy employees know who is pregnant or not?  According to the NYT, the birth tourism rule raises the burden of proof for pregnant women by outlining in writing that giving birth in the country “is an impermissible basis” for visiting the United States.  So, even if a woman says she is entering the country for medical treatment — a legitimate factor for visa eligibility — she will need to convince visa officers that she has enough money to pay for such treatments.  She will also need to prove that the medical care she is seeking is not available in her home country.  “If an applicant’s responses to this line of questions are not credible, that may give consular officers reason to question whether the applicant qualifies for a visa,” Risch explains.  It is unclear how effective the new rule will be in practice  Some visas allow foreigners to visit the United States multiple times over the course of as many as 10 years. This means an applicant could be granted a visa, get pregnant years later and still be permitted to visit the country.  However, pregnant women applying for US visas close to the delivery date could be denied.  “Unless D.H.S (Department of Homeland Security) changes how its officers interpret travel for pleasure to be consistent with the State Department rule, then people will still come to the United States to give birth. This won’t stop that happening,” says Theresa Cardinal Brown, Director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.  Trump breezed into the White House on an anti-immigrant sentiment (NYT) AFP  Sung Yeon Choimorrow, the Executive Director of the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum, says the rule was designed to intimidate young women.“I’m sorry, but pregnant women travel all the time. We go visit other countries. No one should be asked about their bodily physical condition,\" she says.  Kerri Talbot, Director of federal advocacy for Immigration Hub, says the State Department is wrong for not specifying how officers abroad would determine if a traveler was pregnant.  “It is absurd that the Trump administration is turning embassy employees into reproductive policemen,” Talbot says.  While State Department officials said officers abroad would not administer pregnancy tests under the new policy, Choimorrow fears the rule’s consequences. She cited an incident last month when a Hong Kong-based airline apologized after making a passenger take a pregnancy test before boarding a flight to Saipan, the largest of the Mariana Islands and a commonwealth of the United States, writes NYT.  “It sends a message that coming to the United States means you forgo the right to your dignity,” Choimorrow adds.  Trump’s anchor babies ban arrives shortly before he unveils a visa restrictions list that includes a handful of countries, with the U.S media reporting this week that Nigeria also made the cut.  With his impeachment trial in the senate heating up and his re-election campaign kicking into gear, Trump has made it clear that he intends to highlight his administration’s efforts at tightening immigration laws, to the American people.  Scratch that. To white supremacists.

He was being interviewed on One TV.  Speaking about the Coronavirus pandemic, Abela remarked that, “almost half of the people who are positive for COVID-19 are migrants who are not in the community but are being kept in isolation. This was done to safeguard the lives of Maltese and Gozitan citizens.”   ADVERTISEMENT  He added that, “although there are some who seem to be rejoicing that the numbers have increased, we must remain prudent, vigilant and follow the advice given by the Health Authorities, without raising any extra alarm or panic.”  “It is important to highlight the fact that the majority of people who are infected are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms,” he continued.  Abela then stressed the importance of finding a balance between health and the economy, stating that the situation is “completely under control.”  He added that, “since we do not have a vaccine just yet, we need to learn how to live with this situation, however, the necessary decisions will be taken because people’s health remains a priority.”  Asked on the immigration crisis, PM Abela remarked that, “there is no complete solution to this problem.”  He said that “this is not a problem we are facing for the first time, however, this year it is felt more because of COVID-19 in our country.”  PM Abela recalled when, in the midst of the pandemic, he went to Libya to address this problem before, and that “I, the Brigadier, and the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Malta ended up under investigation after stopping a number of immigrants from entering.”  “We have done a lot of work to address this sensitive problem, but we have a lot more to do.”  Abela further explained the difficult decision he sometimes would face, even in the middle of the night, where we would have to decide to either let people drown and be responsible for their death, or to rescue them.”  “Although I understand how people are feeling and what they are saying regarding this matter, I ask the public to understand that saving lives should be the decision we take in these extraordinary circumstances because this is not a problem I can completely solve,” he said.  The presenter of the program moved on to say that, in the past few months, Abela has faced a number of challenges, including the global pandemic and the immigration crisis.  In response, Abela remarked that no matter what happens, the Government will be there to address and solve the problem.

Any worker who’s gone through its basic training emerges with something of a battle-ready mindset.

This is the rare fight that the tenacious members of the restaurant industry can’t win alone.

Mobilize (and pay) restaurant workers to feed those in need  There are, tragically, an astronomical number of people who make and serve food for a living who recently lost their jobs. In Georgia, unemployment claims from restaurant-industry workers increased by 118,000 in March, according to the Georgia Department of Labor. There also is an unprecedented number of people in need of meals, from front-line workers to children who had relied on subsidized school (and summer-camp) lunches to families whose wage earners have suffered layoffs, furloughs, or pay cuts. The private and nonprofit sector already is raising and donating funds to pay restaurants and their workers to prepare meals for those in need. But what if the government funded a program to redeploy restaurants and their workers as emergency food providers?  Congress passed a $25 billion COVID-19 bailout for the airline industry but not one tailored to the restaurant industry, which is four times bigger in terms of sales and 18 times bigger in number of jobs. Instead, restaurants were left to compete with all other businesses for federal small-business loans—and smaller, independent restaurants often are missing out on those funds in favor of restaurant chains. In the first round of loan disbursements, seven such chains gobbled up $91 million of the $349 billion available (though many of them returned the loan money after public blowback).  Miller Union chef/co-owner Steven Satterfield and his team mobilized after Emory Healthcare asked him and Forza Storico’s owners to provide meals for hospital workers, many of whom are pulling 12-hour shifts. The effort supplies 400 meals a day between both restaurants, five days a week, thanks to funding not from the feds but from State Farm Arena and the Atlanta Hawks. It’s enabled Satterfield to keep about 60 percent of his employees on the payroll at $15 an hour.  “We’ve just been really fortunate to have something to do while this pandemic is happening because so many people are out of work. So many restaurant workers are furloughed and have no mission except for just to try to navigate their own life,” Satterfield says. “It’s given us a purpose, and we feel really lucky.” He says that, without the work from the initiative, “we would have just been doing piecemeal to-go sales and probably furloughing more people.”  Chef José Andrés, who has used his international nonprofit World Central Kitchen to provide more than 15 million meals for those in need (including passengers on quarantined cruise ships in California and survivors of Hurricane Maria), essentially is proposing a New Deal for the restaurant industry. His plan would have the government pay restaurant-industry professionals to feed their cities’ most vulnerable—on a large scale. (Think arenas and convention centers.) He shared that idea in a phone call in March with chef and restaurateur Hugh Acheson (of 5&10 in Athens and Empire State South and By George in Atlanta), who then came up with his own, scaled-down take, which calls for using federal funds to support cooks in preparing meals each day in their restaurants; as of late April, Acheson’s two restaurants were preparing well over 1,000 meals daily for in-need communities and first responders (paid for by outside contributions). Whether large-scale or small, such efforts—if federally funded—would bring relief not just to restaurants and those in need of meals but to the entire restaurant supply chain, including Georgia’s farmers and shrimpers.  Along with Satterfield and Acheson, other Atlanta chefs are already doing their part, with donations from individuals and the private sector. You can donate meals (from places like Nina & Rafi and Hampton and Hudson) through the Meal Bridge, a website where you sign up to buy food for healthcare workers at the hospital of your choice. You also can donate to the cause through the Castellucci Hospitality Group, where a $15 contribution will ensure the delivery of two meals to healthcare workers as part of CHG’s Feed the Frontline campaign. Petit Chou is delivering meals to the elderly and other high-risk individuals.  Other restaurants have focused their efforts on helping their fellow hospitality workers, predominantly with funding from outside contributions. Gina and Linton Hopkins (Holeman & Finch Public House, Hop’s Chicken, and C. Ellet’s Steakhouse) have partnered with the Lee Initiative, an organization that strives to make the restaurant industry more diverse and equitable, to turn what would have been the Hopkins’s newest venture, Eugene and Elizabeth’s, into a relief center where restaurant workers who’ve been laid off or had their pay significantly reduced can stop by for a to-go meal and supplies like toilet paper, canned food, and diapers. Red Pepper Taqueria has partnered with Sysco, FreshPoint, and Buckhead Meat to provide weekly care packages (with fruits, veggies, meats, and hand sanitizer) for its employees. Staplehouse is taking donations via Venmo (@staplehouserestaurant) to pay its staff to serve meals to out-of-work food-service employees. Yet another effort spearheaded by Electric Hospitality (Golden Eagle, Muchacho, Ladybird Grove & Mess Hall) called #ATLFamilyMeal provides a similar service, working alongside about a dozen partners, including Fox Bros Bar-B-Q and New Realm Brewing, to deliver meals to workers’ homes; a $20 donation covers four meals. So far, #ATLFamilyMeal has hired workers from 100 local restaurants, bars, and breweries to help prepare and deliver more than 10,000 meals.  These are noble and essential efforts on the part of the restaurant industry and the people, organizations, and corporations whose donations support them. (For even more ways to give, see no. 5 below.) But it’s time for the government to step in to sustain this important work—because even after dining rooms reopen, the need to subsidize both the restaurants and the workers ravaged by COVID-19 will continue.   2. Order food to-go  Regardless of when restaurants decide to reopen, the takeout orders that allowed them to hang on during the roughest weeks will continue to be essential to the slow rebuilding of their business. They’ll be essential, too, for those of us who are unwilling to risk visiting even the most overprotective dining room. As of early May, there were more restaurants offering takeout, curbside, or delivery than not. Just take a look at our 50 Best Tacos issue, which we updated to indicate how many of those tacos you can order to-go. (Answer: 48!) And while this is an especially good time to revisit, repeatedly, your all-time favorite spots, you also should use this opportunity to give newer restaurants a try—especially those from the brave souls who opened in the midst of the pandemic. Whether you seek comfort from septuagenarian Busy Bee (there are few greater salves than their fried chicken) or from newborn Talat Market (we’d like to sleep on a bed of that crispy rice salad), there’s no shortage of memorable meals.  3. Buy groceries from restaurants . . .  Running low on eggs, flour, or salad greens? Skip the grocery store and hit up your neighborhood restaurant instead. Many restaurants have pivoted to retail in order to keep the lights on and keep a few employees on payroll, all while offering a low-contact way to stock your pantry—and helping to keep the local food-supply chain intact.  In Decatur, B-Side Bagels bags up orders of Riverview Farms smoked meats, cheeses, grits, and wine for shoppers to retrieve. Kirkwood’s Sun In My Belly sells pantry staples out of its dining room—and delivers them to customers within a four-mile radius. Bell Street Burritos, Hodgepodge Coffeehouse, Wonderkid, Rumi’s Kitchen, Hampton and Hudson, and D.B.A. Barbecue are just a few of the local spots provisioning Atlantans with perishables and household goods (yes, even toilet paper) in low- or no-contact settings.  Inman Park bistro-turned-bodega One Eared Stag started offering groceries out of a to-go window in early April. By selling the produce it would normally use in its farm-to-table kitchen, One Eared Stag is supporting local farmers while figuring out yet another survival mechanism. (One Eared Stag also offers takeout meals.) “Without the bodega right now,” says general manager Matt Reeves, “I don’t know where we’d be standing.”  4. . . . or from farmers  It’s not only service-industry workers who are struggling as a result of the mass closure of restaurants. Suppliers to those restaurants—most notably, the growers who’ve powered the farm-to-table movement—also need extra support to weather the pandemic. The good news is that there are an increasing number of ways to safely buy produce from local growers—which not only will protect their livelihoods but will ensure that, when restaurants reopen, their crops will remain intact. Here are a few local options:  5. Donate what you can, whether to organizations or directly to restaurants  Perhaps one of the best and most immediate ways to help the food-service industry is by donating your dollars to support restaurant workers, many of whom lived paycheck to paycheck prior to the crisis. Few local organizations fulfill this need as greatly and effectively as Giving Kitchen, which provides food-service workers in crisis with small but critical grants. Since the start of the pandemic, the organization—the sister nonprofit to Staplehouse—has provided over $200,000 in financial assistance to workers who’ve experienced illnesses including COVID-19 (or are under doctor’s order to quarantine). Giving Kitchen also offers assistance through its Stability Network for restaurant workers who don’t suffer directly from COVID-19 but, rather, from its vast economic impact. The Stability Network creates partnerships with and offers referrals to dozens of groups that provide aid for everything from housing to mental health to immigration issues to family services. “In every phase of our work, we’re experiencing an unprecedented response,” says executive director Bryan Schroeder. “We will never have to explain ‘why Giving Kitchen’ again.”  You also can support the staffs of your favorite restaurants by giving money directly to them. Dozens of restaurants have launched employee relief campaigns on crowdfunding platform GoFundMe, with ones like Kimball House, Redbird, and those belonging to the Fifth Group collective raising tens of thousands of dollars for former employees in less than a month. A comprehensive (and searchable) index of those campaigns can be found at ReliefAtlanta.com.  6. Invest in dining bonds  Like savings bonds, dining bonds offer buyers credit to be redeemed at a later date. What makes the concept more attractive than gift cards is that they’re sold at a discount: A bond that costs $100 today could be worth $125 when it matures in, say, three months, when a restaurant reopens. The idea was the brainchild of Helen Patrikis and Steven Hall, two New York PR professionals who serve the hospitality industry. They launched their website, the Dining Bond Initiative, on the weekend before St. Patrick’s Day, and, within a month, nearly 500 participating restaurants around the world signed up. The service is free to the restaurants, whose owners set their own terms and sell the actual bonds. An interactive map helps users find locations near them.  Atlanta-area participants include Gusto!, NaanStop, and South of Philly. Gusto! founder Nate Hybl estimates the program brought his company close to $60,000 in its first month, all of which went toward paying team members. Before the pandemic, he had about 200 employees at five locations (two more are in the works), but about 30 percent have been laid off, at least temporarily. Sales initially dropped 70 percent, despite Gusto!’s niche of providing portable, fresh food. Dining Bond proceeds have helped save more jobs. “We are so thankful to the Atlanta community,” Hybl says. “The dining bonds are an amazing sign of belief in us. We have tremendous gratitude.”  Patrikis designed the program specifically to help restaurants survive. “We really admire and love the people in the restaurant industry,” she says. “They’re givers. They’re generous and hard-working. They are always the first ones to help out when there’s a charity or a humanitarian crisis and people need food. Whenever there’s something to celebrate or an occasion to mark, you’re going to your favorite restaurant. What’s it going to look like when this is over if they’re not there?”  7. Buy a private dinner  At charity auctions, private dinners hosted by local chefs are often a choice bid. Canoe chef Matthew Basford and co-owner Gerry Klaskala have raised $20,000 multiple times at High Museum auctions. But opportunities for such exclusive affairs are rare—or at least they used to be. Basford’s team already is considering auctioning off a dinner to raise money for staff. “It’s very hard to get us to come to your home as a restaurant,” he says. “But [it’s different] if it’s something to raise funds for staff and to keep the restaurant alive.” And Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q is offering a 50-person backyard barbecue for $6,000, with all proceeds going toward employee assistance. Short of that, you can book almost any restaurant for a future private party. You’ll have to pay early (or at least put down a solid deposit), then wait for your dinner; but if you were planning to splurge on an upcoming occasion, you’ll never have a better chance to recruit your favorite chef.  8. Local government: cut the red tape  As the number of COVID-19 cases mounted and restaurants temporarily closed their doors or pivoted to takeout, local governments tried to help keep them open by easing rules on selling to-go alcohol and classifying them as essential businesses. But policymakers should view those efforts as first steps and should listen to what restaurateurs need during an unprecedented time. While the newly created Independent Restaurant Coalition (chaired by Miller Union chef/co-owner Steven Satterfield) lobbies the federal government for relief on the national level, the Georgia Restaurant Association has urged local and state governments to grant sales-tax holidays and temporary breaks on business fees, and to defer taxes on purchases until the pandemic eases. Not all those proposals will happen. But the passage of some could mean the difference between a beloved ramen spot reopening when COVID-19 treatment and vaccines are available and a “For Rent” sign popping up in the restaurant’s window.  9. Fight for restaurant workers to get better health insurance and sick leave  Georgia’s laws favor businesses more than workers, and the state prohibits cities and counties from passing labor-friendly policies like increasing the minimum wage, requiring paid leave, and establishing fair scheduling, which would push employers to provide workers with more predictable schedules and better protections. The gaps caused by those preemption laws (not to mention’s the state’s refusal to expand Medicaid) have left those in food service among the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic—and the least protected.  Ideally, all restaurant owners would be able to offer affordable healthcare coverage to their employees, but that’s unlikely, given the industry’s razor-thin profit margins and workers’ low wages. Another, perhaps equally unlikely option is for the state legislature to expand Medicaid coverage. At the very least, says Alex Camardelle, a senior policy analyst with the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, Georgia could join the 13 other states that guarantee workers paid leave, no longer forcing servers, bartenders, and kitchen staff to work sick, which is unhealthy for them and unsafe for coworkers and customers. Some companies temporarily implemented paid sick leave policies as coronavirus spread. That’s a start, but employers and—better yet—the state should commit to making these changes permanent.  The feast or famine practice of tipping, erratic work schedules, and a state minimum wage that hasn’t increased in 15 years can make it hard for restaurant workers to maintain a steady budget or handle an unexpected expense. “All of the sudden, these folks who we consider to be low-wage workers, who were scraping by, are the essential workforce,” Camardelle says. “If this doesn’t force us to [raise the minimum wage] in the near future, I don’t know what will. It’s always been a lack of sheer political will. It will be a complete denial of these people’s humanity and their worth.”  10. Be supportive of the vastly different style of restaurant that could emerge as the pandemic recedes  If you think that offering benefits and paying workers livable wages on razor-thin profit margins was hard enough before COVID-19, just imagine what it will be like in the aftermath of the pandemic—when restaurants will have reduced occupancies (perhaps by as much as 50 percent). Also: Gone, for a while at least, will be the days of waiting for your table—and running up a tab—at the shoulder-to-shoulder bar. “What we made in a day is now what we make in a week,” says Gee Smalls, co-owner of Virgil’s Gullah Kitchen & Bar in downtown College Park. The restaurant has pivoted to takeout and delivery (through Uber Eats and DoorDash), but a large part of Virgil’s success since opening a year ago was its busting-at-the-seams weekend bar scene. “We’re using this downtime to think of ways to do things better and strengthen our restaurant.”  We’ve long needed to build a better, more equitable, more worker-protective restaurant; now, we need to build a more diner-protective one—all based on a business model that actually keeps the restaurant afloat. For that miracle to happen, we need to be ready, as diners, to assume some of the cost—at a time when many of us have new financial struggles of our own. It might become more expensive to eat out than it was before. Or the more luxe experience at a given restaurant might become more casual and, given the masked servers and required temperature readings, weirder. Nobody yet knows exactly what the postpandemic restaurant will look like. (Well, our former dining critic Corby Kummer might; he’s working with the James Beard Foundation and the Aspen Institute’s Food and Society Program to establish new safety protocols for restaurants.) The biggest thing to keep in mind is that, going forward, restaurants will require an unusual amount of patience and patronage—and however much you’re able to give will be worth it.

We’re talking about a long, skinny territory — a geographic gerrymander — that stretches east across New Mexico and down the Texan Rio Grande to the Gulf of Mexico. It also runs west across hundreds of miles of desert to California and the Pacific Ocean. Like the old Wild West, this one is lawless, save for the law of the gun. But that old West was lawless for want of government. This one is lawless because of it.  The Department of Homeland Security, under authority conferred by Congress, has declared nearly 50 federal laws inoperable along sections of the U.S. boundary with Mexico, the better to build the border wall that Donald Trump has promised his “base.” Innumerable state laws and local ordinances have also been swept aside. Predictably, the Endangered Species Act is among the fallen. So are the National Historic Preservation Act, the Wilderness Act, laws restricting air and water pollution, and measures protecting wildlife, landscapes, Native American sacred sites, and even caves and fossils.  The new Wild West of the border wall is an authoritarian dreamscape where the boss man faces no limits and no obligations. It’s as though Marshall Wyatt Earp, reborn as an orange-haired easterner with no knowledge of the actual West, were back in charge, deciding who’s in and who’s out, what goes and what stays.  Prominent on the list of suspended laws is the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, which, until recently, was the nation’s look-before-you-leap conscience. The environmental analyses and impact statements NEPA requires might not force the government to evaluate whether a palisade of 30-foot-high metal posts — bollards in border wall terminology — were really a better way to control drug smuggling than upgrading inspection facilities at ports of entry, where, by all accounts, the vast majority of illegal substances enter the country. They would, however, require those wall builders to figure out in advance a slew of other gnarly questions like: How will wildlife be affected by a barrier that nothing larger than a kangaroo rat can get through? And how much will pumping scarce local water to make concrete draw down shallow desert aquifers?  The questions get big, fast. One that might look easy but isn’t concerns the flashfloods that stream down desert washes. The uprights of the border wall are to be spaced only four inches apart, which means they’ll catch flood debris the way a colander catches spaghetti.  Let’s get specific. The San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge abuts the border in the far southeastern corner of Arizona. Black Draw, a gulch running through the middle of the refuge, is normally as dry as a hot sidewalk. When thunderstorms burst over the vast San Bernardino Valley, however, the floodwaters can surge more than 20 feet high. Imagine a wall of chocolate water sweeping up tree trunks, uprooted bushes, the occasional dead cow, and fence posts snarled in wire. Imagine what happens when that torrent meets a barrier built like a strainer. The junk catches and creates a dam. Water backs up, and pressure builds. If the wall were built like the Hoover Dam, it might hold, but it won’t be and it won’t.  In 2014, a flood in Black Draw swept vehicle barriers aside, scattering pieces downstream. Local ranchers have shown me the pictures. You could say the desert was making a point about how wet it could be. In fact, there’s no mystery about what will happen when such a flood hits a top-heavy palisade. If a NEPA document were to evaluate the border wall, the passage discussing this eventuality might require its writer to invent a term for what a wall becomes when it lies flat on the ground.  With NEPA out of the picture, the responsible parties only have to claim that they’ll figure out a solution later and, when “later” comes, maybe they’ll have conveniently moved on to other jobs.   Pittsburgh on the Border  Meanwhile, there’s another question that won’t have to be dealt with: How much water will the wall’s construction require? The answer matters in an area where water’s scarce. Again, the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge offers a useful vantage point for considering the question.  To get to the refuge, you drive east from the town of Douglas along the Geronimo Trail, an unpaved two-lane country road that earns its name honestly. Nineteenth-century Apache leader Geronimo surrendered to the U.S. military in the mountains on the horizon just ahead of you. Shortly before you reach the refuge, you top a low rise overlooking what the local assessor initially mistook for a new industrial park. It was as if a section of Pittsburgh or Youngstown had suddenly sprouted from the desert, with enough mesquite and creosote bush scraped away to accommodate a concrete-batching plant, office trailers, and a massive staging area and machinery yard.  Stacks of steel bollards stand taller than houses, covering the space of a neighborhood. A grid of steel rails for laying out those bollards and welding them into pre-fab wall sections occupies another acre or two, beyond which stacks of completed sections cover yet more acres. In front of those stacks, a few scraps of wall stand vertical but disjointed, like shrines to a metal god — probably practice erections, if you’ll pardon the phrase. Scattered through the site are forklifts, graders, loaders, bulldozers, excavators, pickup trucks, flatbeds, and cranes. Generators and floodlights on wheeled rigs are parked at the margins, ready to illuminate round-the-clock shifts. Close to the batching tower, which may rival the Gadsden Hotel in Douglas as the tallest structure in Cochise County, cement trucks cluster like a litter of puppies.  And more steel keeps arriving. An approaching cloud of dust on the Geronimo Trail signals a line of incoming semis loaded with still more bollards. They pass newly posted signs that say: “Be Aware: Equipment Has the Right of Way” and “Risk Takers Are Accident Makers.”  These details, however, are prelude to the main event. If you look toward Mexico, a half-mile of wall already stands in place, undulating with the hills. Think of it as a dark, linear Steelhenge, a monolith screening the shimmering Sonoran mountains to the south. You can see where the next sections will be raised. Construction has already reached the refuge.  Where the Deer and the Antelope Better Not Play  The surface and subsurface flow of water from nearly the entire San Bernardino Valley converges at the refuge, creating an oasis in the heart of the desert. If this were the Sahara, caravansaries would have stopped by its green pools for thousands of years. As it is, Apaches, Yaquis, Tohono O’odham, and their predecessors have used its waters since time out of mind, as did the Spaniards, Mexicans, and Americans who later strove to take the land from them and from each other. The ponds lie half-hidden amid jungles of reeds.  San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge is modest as refuges go — only 2,369 acres — but it was once part of the sprawling, 73,240-acre Slaughter Ranch, two-thirds of which lay in Mexico. Next to the refuge, the ranch headquarters, now a historic site, has its own big pond. From that pond or any of those on the refuge, a major-league slugger could knock a baseball out of the country.  Contractors building the wall have drilled three wells along the border and leased a fourth. Tanker trucks constantly shuttle between the wells and the concrete plant. Nobody is saying how much water wall construction will consume. The foundation for the wall will be — what? A yard wide and seven-feet deep? Ten-feet deep? Sorry, that’s privileged information, not for public consumption.  Anyway, the foundation just in this area will run for scores of miles, farther than you can see, and consume enough concrete to build a small town — and concrete requires water. Lots of it.  How much will the pumping deplete local aquifers? Nobody knows because, absent NEPA, nobody has had to figure it out. There’s been no modeling, no serious testing, no reliable calculations. Still, local ranchers would like to know the answer. They depend on wells and water tanks scattered through the desert scrub where their cattle drink.  Good luck to them. And good luck, as well, to the critters for which the refuge is supposed to provide… well, refuge.  I could print a list of the unusual fish, frogs, snails, snakes, and other living things that are found here and almost nowhere else on Earth, not to mention the rare plants, the itinerant mammals (some also rare), and the hundreds of species of birds that use this place. In the desert, reliable water is a kind of miracle that attracts and creates other miracles.  San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, you might say, is a cluster of miracles. There are too many to list. And a long list of weird names would take up a lot of space and sound pinheaded. I care a lot about those creatures, but I don’t want to sound like that.  To be honest, I’m almost afraid to learn the names of some of the refuge’s creatures because then it would only hurt all the more if they decline to extinction. The wall will certainly nudge, or maybe shove, many of them in that direction. Nevertheless, I have to mention two of them. Their names suggest a kind of taxonomic poetry, a nature music. They aren’t necessarily the rarest, but they sound the best: Yaqui topminnow. Chiricahua leopard frog. The words fall on the ears like melodies, evoking the mystery of tender life in a harsh land. As members of a species, you and I are as common as coal. In the big biological scheme of things, creatures like these are rubies and sapphires.  Forget Policy, Follow the Metaphor  It’s impossible to understand the wall, at least in the San Bernardino Valley, in terms of policy. As one rancher put it to me over coffee at the Gadsden Hotel, “This [wall] may be needed someplace, but it isn’t needed here.”  If Trump’s wall were really about policy, its advantages and disadvantages would be weighed against other strategies requiring different kinds of investment. But this is the new Wild West, where rational judgment, laws, and procedures only get in the way.  The truth of the wall lies in metaphor. If Chiricahua leopard frog conveys a kind of poetic resonance to people like me, then for millions of others chanting “Build the Wall!” is like hitting a big bass drum. Everybody understands wall! Even if the structure doesn’t actually work in physical space, it works in your mind. It stands between you and everything bad you can imagine. The core truth that unites Trump and his supporters is that he hates who we hate — and the border wall stands for keeping out those unwanted people and all they represent.  This is why the wall can’t coexist with NEPA.Impact statements don’t do imagery. If you really want to crack down on drug smuggling, for example, you’d concentrate your efforts at established ports of entry, where billions of dollars of goods and millions of people cross from one country to the other every day. The bulk of the fentanyl, cocaine, heroin, and other hard drugs entering the U.S. is reportedly concealed among legitimate imports in railroad cars and trucks of every description. Or they get stashed in secret compartments in buses, vans, cars, and pickup trucks. (The U.S. mail is another major conduit.) Currently, it’s estimated that more than $4 billion in new scanners, inspection lanes, and the people to staff them are needed. Making that investment would have infinitely more impact on drug flow than using the same money to install bollards where they aren’t needed and won’t last. There are better ways to handle people, too, but let’s not get distracted from the real story.  Expenditures on wall construction in Fiscal Year 2019 ran to approximately $10 billion. Only a third of that amount was actually appropriated by Congress for border security structures. Delivering the rest of the money required masterful circumventions of constitutional intent.  Here’s one of them: each year Congress appropriates so-called 2808 funds to the Department of Defense for construction projects on military bases, including schools, clinics, roads, and other infrastructure. Such expenditures are restricted to military property and the international border with Mexico isn’t — or wasn’t — a military base. For the Trumpistas, however, not a problem.  In 1907, President Teddy Roosevelt reserved a 60-foot easement from the public domain along the southern border to keep it “free from obstruction as a protection against the smuggling of goods between the United States and Mexico.” Since then, the “Roosevelt easement” has been administered by the Bureau of Land Management, but last year the Trump administration transferred the easement to the Department of Defense, which obligingly assigned it as a real-estate asset to Fort Bliss, Texas.  Voila! Now, the Roosevelt Easement is part of a military base and a tendril of Fort Bliss officially extends into Arizona, New Mexico, and California — but not Texas. (The Lone Star State reserved its public land for itself when it entered the union, so no Roosevelt Easement there.) Technically, border wall construction within the easement now constitutes an improvement to Fort Bliss, enhancing military preparedness, yadda, yadda, yadda. There’s more to it than that, including the president’s formal declaration of a national emergency last February, which enabled certain other steps, but you get the idea. Where there’s a will, there’s an imperial way.  As it happens, however, the Pentagon’s money for funding wall construction across the foot of the San Bernardino refuge itself comes from a different pot: “284” funds, intended for counter-narcotics work. Diverting $2.5 billion of these monies to the border wall was, to say the least, a stretch, so a coalition of humanitarian and environmental groups sued. A district court found in their favor and issued an injunction, halting the use of the funds for construction. A rapid series of appeals went to the Supreme Court and the Supremes said, Hmmm, interesting question, which will take time for the lower courts to resolve; meanwhile, the injunction is lifted. And so funding again flowed like a flash flood. If the courts ultimately decide that the transfer of funds is really not okay, the wall may already have been built. Thank you, Supremes.   Dollars and Nonsense  I forgot to mention something: in addition to suspending nearly 50 laws protecting lands, wildlife, and the public interest, the government has also waived many procurement laws and also buried a lot of contract information. This means you and I will have a hard time learning what anything actually costs, even though our tax dollars are paying for it.  Example: the barrier to be built along the edge of the San Bernardino refuge, cutting off its terrestrial wildlife from the Mexican half of its world and quite possibly draining the ponds where some of the planet’s rarest creatures survive, is part of a contract for 63 miles of border wall awarded to Southwest Valley Constructors (SWVC), a subsidiary of Kiewit, a Fortune 500 company with $9 billion in annual sales.  The original May 2019 contract awarded $646 million to SWVC, putting the cost of the refuge wall at $10.25 million per mile, a veritable steal. But you would need to know someone who can log into the relevant government database to discover that the fifth modification of the original contract, signed on August 29th, added another $653 million to the kitty. Now, those 63 miles are going to cost $1.3 billion, or almost $21 million per mile.  And by the way, did I mention that construction will include a power line and floodlights on 60-foot masts to illuminate the wall all night long, every night of the year? I have friends in the San Bernardino Valley who just about weep — and they aren’t weepy people — when they think about the lights on that wall blazing away in what used to be the immense, holy darkness of their formerly unblemished land.  I can get pretty choked up about it myself, but you can be sure that smugglers won’t. Here’s where things get truly weird: believe it or not, darkness is an ally of the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP). Its people have night vision goggles and its drones and other sensors have infrared detectors. They don’t need light. Flood the border with light and, counter-intuitively, the CBP is blinded, losing an advantage. Whose idea was this? Nobody’s saying, but it seems to have come from, ahem, the highest level. Good thing NEPA doesn’t apply.  Let’s turn up the weirdness a little bit further: out in western Arizona, close to the California line, you come to the Barry M. Goldwater Range (BMGR). Here, young Air Force and Marine pilots learn to strafe and bomb. Migrants have been known to cross the international border at the BMGR but, according to court filings, over the past five years migrants have gotten in the way of only 195 of 255,732 air sorties – less than 0.1%.  An already existing pedestrian barrier along much of the range’s border possibly contributes to this low level of trespass — and the bombs and bullets may help, too. But the decisive factor is undoubtedly the range’s spectacular heat and aridity and the mortally long distances a migrant would have to walk to reach any possible pick-up or rendezvous spot. Nevertheless a second wall, backing up the first, is now slated for construction at BMGR, with a road sandwiched between the two walls, down which CBP patrols will race like hamsters on a flattened wheel.  Let’s just agree, as former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Joseph Dunford, Jr., did in a memorandum to then-acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, that double-walling the BMGR makes no sense in terms of policy. In terms of metaphor, however, double-walling a border where essentially nobody goes is perfectly logical. If the goal is to build miles of wall, costs and benefits be damned, you might as well build them where there’s nobody to get in the way. Build the wall!  And so it is indeed being built, at the cost of violating not just the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, but Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, Organ Pipe National Monument, the Lower Rio Grande National Wildlife Refuge, the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge, the historic town center of Roma, Texas, and other sublime and exceptional places. One might ask why so much uniqueness and rarity lies along our southern border. The short answer is that the borderlands are the meeting place of biological communities as well as cultures. As Chicano performance artist Guillermo Gómez-Peña puts it, “The border is the juncture, not the edge.”  But an edge is exactly what President Trump’s wall would make it. Wall construction was and remains his foremost campaign pledge: 500 miles of wall by November of 2020, or 450 miles, or whatever the number du jour happens to be. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Washington Post, and others have tried to deflate the president’s boasts by asserting that he’s actually built no new wall and his promises are empty.  In their calculations, substituting a 30-foot-tall wall for vehicle barriers is only “replacement” and therefore doesn’t constitute “new” construction. That’s like arguing that mooring an aircraft carrier where a rowboat used to be changes nothing because there’s still just one vessel in the harbor. Such semantic jousting only camouflages the pervasive damage already being done both to people and to the land on the border — and there’s no end in sight. The congressional budget agreement hammered out in December 2019 appropriates another $1.375 billion for wall construction for fiscal year 2020, while removing obstacles to yet more transfers of Pentagon funds. And Trump is not being shy about those transfers. He evidently plans to divert $7.2 billion more from legitimate Pentagon projects to wall building this year.  The international drug cartels should be thanking us. The wall will not curb their principal business of smuggling and the Trump administration’s new immigration policies have turned what was formerly a minor sideline — kidnapping people for ransom — into a growth industry. Tens of thousands of asylum seekers to whom the U.S. has refused entry are now huddled in cardboard slums in Mexico’s border towns, vulnerable to human predators. Their relatives in the United States — the people they were trying to reach — will beg, borrow, or steal to pay the ransoms that the increasingly busy (and brutal) kidnappers in Mexico demand.  That, however, is just “collateral damage” in the “land of the free.” Of course, we treat asylum seekers as though they were an inferior variety of human being. And we treat the borderlands and its creatures with the same loyalty we showed the Kurds. After all, we are America. Behind our wall, we are “great” again.

An audio clip of proceedings of the meeting shows how the diplomats at the embassy in Copenhagen sat with their junior staff and agreed to share the money.  At the end of each financial year, government institutions are required by law to return all unused balances to the Treasury in Kampala.  Section 17 (2) of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2005 stipulates: “A vote that does not expend money appropriated to it for the financial year shall at the close of the financial year, repay the money to the Consolidated Fund.”  A source in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that the voices in the clip belonged to their officers at the Uganda mission in Denmark.  In the clip the diplomats are heard discussing how they would raise funds to bribe auditors who would certainly find what one of them described as “jumbled funds” at the mission.  The spokesperson for the Inspector General of Government, Ms Munira Ali, told Daily Monitor that their office has registered many complaints against Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but said she was not sure about the specific cases being investigated.  “I am not sure whether the contents of that particular clip are part of what is under investigation. I would have to find out,” Ms Ali said by telephone on Friday.  The outgoing accounting officer at the embassy, Ms Alex Hope Mukubwa, on May 25, wrote to the Permanent Secretary and Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Keith Muhakanizi, requesting to be allowed to retain the unspent funds.  Ms Mukubwa argued that it was necessary to retain some funds for transport and settlement of a new Financial Attaché’ who had been posted to the mission. The unnamed Attaché had been unable to take up her position at the mission in March due to travel restrictions following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Mr Muhakanizi, however, rejected the request.  “In light of this legal provision (Section 17 (2) of the PFMA) you are required to remit unspent balances to the Consolidated Fund at the end of the Financial Year and provide evidence of remittance…the purpose of this letter therefore is to inform you as above and advise you to remit all unspent balances at the close of the Financial Year (2019/2020,” Mr Muhakanizi wrote back to the embassy on June 11.  Sources privy to the goings-on at the Mission told Daily Monitor that Mr Muhakanizi’s communication prompted the diplomatic staff to convene a Zoom meeting although the mission has been closed for several months due to Covid-19.  We could not independently verify the attendees of the meeting. But the senior embassy officials who would ordinarily attend such a meeting include the Head of Mission, Ms Nimisha Madhvani, Deputy Head of Mission, Mr Elly Kamahungye Kafeero, Ms Alex Hope Mukubwa, the Minister Counsellor / Accounting Officer, Mr Gordon Katureebe, the First Secretary, Mr Richard Biribonwoha, the Third Secretary / Head of Chancery, Ms Sylvia Nambooze Kayongo, the Administrative Attache, and Mr Mugisha Wilfred, the Immigration Attache.  Ms Mukubwa and Ms Nimisha Madhvani have been stuck in Uganda due to travel restrictions, but being a virtual meeting anyone can attend from any part of the world.  In the recording a male voice is heard telling his colleagues that they could allocate themselves some of the unspent money as per diem and not Safari allowances. Then an another official asks about the number of days they would be entitled to for per diem.  At this point, a female voice interjects.  “That is why I am asking. For who? How much for each? I thought for each eight days,” she says in the recording.  A male voice is then heard revealing the criteria of how to share the money.  “Head of Mission eight days, deputy head of mission eight days, accounting Officer eight days and they [junior staff] decided for themselves that each one four days,” he says, but is overruled by the female voice who proposes that the other staff be given per diem for six days.  Under the Foreign Affairs standing orders officers at ambassadorial level are entitled to per diem of $390 (about Shs1.4m) per a day, while junior staff are entitled to $360 (about Shs1.3m) a day. Going by that arrangement, each of the three top diplomats at the Uganda mission ‘earned’ $3,120 (about Shs11.4) as per diem for no work done, while their junior colleagues took $2,160 (about Shs8m).  It is not clear how much each took in the per diem racket as Daily Monitor could not readily establish the number of staff at the embassy in Denmark.  A source at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said per diem is only given when an officer is going out on official business outside the mission. Ordinarily the officer is thereafter meant to compile a report about the business they attended.  The source said it will be interesting to see the kind of reports and accountability the officials at the Denmark mission submit to Kampala given the travel restrictions in force.  At some point during the Zoom meeting, one of the participants protests the criteria of money sharing stipulated by the male and female voices in the recording. The official complained that junior staff such as a driver would end up earning much more than the middle level staff. However the top diplomats silence the complainant.  The female voice is also heard telling her subordinates to find ways of making use of all unspent balances before end of the financial year, which ended in June.  “So we share with these two people that whatever there is in those other balances find a way to utilise the funds… and not to discuss with the local staff. Please do not discuss this with the home-based Mugisha’s and the others,” she says in the recording.  It was not possible to talk to Ms Madhvani about the contents of the audio regarding her embassy. She neither answered our phone calls nor responded to text messages sent to her mobile telephone number.   Admission of bribery  Under terms of service in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs government is meant to pay 75 per cent of an officer’s utility bills. However embassy funds have often been abused with some missions paying 100 per cent of their officers’ bills.  Where that happens and it is discovered, the Ministry directs such officers to pay back the money.  At some point during the Zoom discussion the male voice is heard telling his colleagues that this can be avoided depending on who the accounting officer is at a particular mission. He confessed to have given a bribe in order to have the matter covered up during audit.  “When I was in Switzerland they asked officers who had gone back to Kampala to pay, but since I was the Accounting Officer I wanted to protect my former colleagues. I discussed with the auditor, the head of mission was also good. He was concurring with me. So twamulabamu (bribed him) as a mission. Twamulabamu nabidroppinga (We bribed him and he dropped the query).”   Preparing to bribe auditors  During the same meeting where some of the officers also talked about using embassy funds to buy a new rice cooker, new sofa sets and televisions, the male voice revealed that the Mission, which has no accountant currently, will end up with jumbled accounts.  He suggested that all the staff join hands to raise money to bribe the auditors whenever they showed up at the mission.  “I will talk in parables so that you understand. You are prepared to ensure that the other person gets to understand and when I say that the other person gets to understand you know what I mean. So we are going to get a way of how we get to last year we did… that is what we did. We get like two days which we will share between all of us, then you will bring that money to me so that we shall put it in a safe. By the time they come to audit it will be the new accounting officer who will be there. So that money will be put in a safe,” he said.   Ministry says  When contacted, the Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary, Mr Patrick Mugoya, wondered why the embassy officials would discuss per diems in a meeting.  “Why would people be discussing per diems in a meeting? I thought they would be discussing work. I would have to understand the context in which they were speaking. The mission will have to explain,” he told Daily Monitor by telephone on Friday.   fdraku@ug.nationmedia.com  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 25, "positive": 36, "negative": 14, "disgust": 1, "joy": 7, "anger": 11, "fear": 3, "trust": 13}, "metadata": ["embassy", "proceedings", "ministry", "spokesperson", "ali", "outbreak", "inform", "deputy", "minister", "richard", "immigration", "proposes", "participants", "protests", "messages", "ensure"]}, {"text": "A new survey in AARP’s She’s the Difference series explores the concerns of women voters ages 50 and older in South Carolina, a crucial primary state. Below are some highlights from the poll.   On Voting  Democratic women voters ages 50 and older in South Carolina are highly motivated to vote.  More than 9 in 10 (93%) self-identified Democratic older women voters say they will at least probably vote, with nearly 8 in 10 (79%) saying they will definitely vote.   On Healthcare  Healthcare is a primary concern across party lines for South Carolina’s older women voters.  No matter who stands for election next November, leaders will need to find ways to better address concerns over healthcare — the most important issue among women voters ages 50 and older in South Carolina and across the nation.  Older women in South Carolina believe healthcare is the most important issue facing the country (34%), ahead of terrorism (27%) and immigration (26%).  Nearly 8 in 10 (78%) older women voters in South Carolina give elected officials a D or an F grade on dealing with the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs.  Majorities have an unfavorable view of pharmaceutical companies (65%) and health insurance companies (54%).  Across party lines, these South Carolina voters agree that drug companies charging too much for medication is the number one reason for rising healthcare costs.  For many women voters ages 50 and older in South Carolina, healthcare costs are both a personal and pocketbook issue.  70% know someone without health insurance (79% among African American women).  35% say they can’t afford to pay for their healthcare.  34% say they have skipped medical care because it was too expensive.  26% have rationed prescription medications due to high costs.  22% have gone into debt because of high medical costs.   On Financial Security  Many older women voters in South Carolina have concerns over their financial security and would like to see a stronger Social Security system.  Overall, only 17% are very confident they will have enough money to live comfortably throughout their retirement years, a figure that is lower for African American women (6%), those living in small towns or rural areas (10%), and those living with a disability (11%).  Social Security is by far the primary source of income that these South Carolina voters plan to rely on as they get older (78%), but insufficient Social Security benefits are also the primary reason that older women voters are not confident in their retirement (68%).  Healthcare costs and disabilities also weigh on older women voter’s financial confidence: Among those who aren’t confident they will be able to live comfortably throughout their retirement, 41% say a primary reason is healthcare costs, and 32% say they or someone in their family have a disability.  Older women voters in South Carolina show strong bipartisan support for strengthening Social Security: 93% of Democrats and 85% of Republicans agree that we should strengthen Social Security so every American has a chance to retire.   Methodology  The Harris Poll conducted this online and phone survey on behalf of AARP December 5–25, 2019. The sample has 1,000 registered women voters ages 50 and older in South Carolina.  The data from phone and online interviews were combined and weighted to reflect known demographics. The data are weighted to the population of female South Carolina residents ages 50 and older using population benchmarks from the Census Bureau’s March 2019 Current Population Survey and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 2017 National Health Interview Survey.  Weighting by education, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, marital status, household income, employment status, and landline/cell phone usage bring these data into line with the actual proportions in the population. Propensity score weighting was also used to adjust for respondents’ propensity to be online to ensure representativeness among the online respondents.  For telephone respondents, number of phone lines, recent phonelessness, and number of adults in the household were also included to account for probability of selection. Raked weights are estimated using random iterative method weighting.  For more information, contact Rachelle Cummins at rcummins@aarp.org. For media inquiries, contact media@aarp.org.

The 64-year-old African American great-grandmother spent 21 years in prison for a nonviolent drug offense before Trump commuted her sentence in 2018. She then became the unwitting star of his reelection campaign's $10-million Super Bowl ad, which featured footage of Johnson's emotional release from prison as she praised 'Donald John Trump.'  'I'm an African American woman and he signed my paper. How could I turn around and say he's a racist?' Johnson said in an interview this past week. 'I believe in judging people by the things that they've done.'  As the next phase of the 2020 presidential campaign begins, Trump's team is betting that his actions, more than his words, on issues such as criminal justice, education and abortion will allow him to chip away at the Democrats' overwhelming advantage with African Americans, Latinos and women.  The high-stakes effort is backed by tens of millions of dollars, an expansive field program and a sophisticated digital operation aimed at peeling away even a narrow slice of the voters who make up the backbone of the Democratic Party's political base.  Trump's strategy is complicated by his leadership on the coronavirus pandemic that has taken a disproportionately devastating toll on minority communities. His divisive record on immigration and race is hard to overlook. He said there were 'very fine people on both sides' of the deadly protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 against white supremacists, and his administration has separated thousands of immigrant children from their parents at the Mexican border.  In an interview, NAACP President Derrick Johnson seized on Trump's coronavirus response and the related impact on the African American community, predicting that the president's inability to control the outbreak would 'overshadow any other issue' this fall.  'Everything lies at the feet of the president,' Johnson said. 'It's not a partisan criticism, it's a leadership criticism. This nation is lacking the leadership necessary to contain this pandemic so that Americans across all communities are safe.'  Recent polls show that a majority of Americans agree that Trump's response to the outbreak has been too slow.  Trump's campaign team concedes that the pandemic has temporarily derailed its plans. The campaign was forced to delay the previously announced opening of \"Black Voices for Trump\" offices in 15 black communities, for example, relying instead on a series of phone and online 'real talk' sessions to engage black voters. This past week, the campaign hosted calls with people of color in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  On the calls, Trump's team noted that his administration has sent hundreds of millions of dollars to historically black colleges and universities, and that more than $1 billion was set aside for HBCUs and minority-serving institutions as part of Congress' coronavirus response package.  In late 2018, Trump signed into law a criminal justice bill that has led to the release of thousands of prisoners. His campaign reports that 90% of prisoners whose sentences were reduced as a result of the bill are African Americans. Trump also used his presidential power to grant clemency to a handful of people of color such as Johnson, who caught his attention with the help of reality television star Kim Kardashian.  In the interview, Alice Marie Johnson shared her excitement about being able to attend family Christmases, Fourths of July and her first family wedding at the end of the year. She drove a car for the first time in more than two decades last week. She's eager to defend Trump against the fierce criticism he usually gets from communities of color.  Johnson has lost the right to vote because she is a convicted felon, and she declined to say whether she would vote for Trump if she could. But she offered a rosy assessment of Trump's reelection outlook: 'He's changed the minds of a whole lot of people with his leadership.'  Some Democrats fear she may be right.  The most powerful super PAC in Democratic politics, Priorities USA, and one of the party's most powerful union allies, the Service Employees International Union, are pouring millions of dollars into separate campaigns to win over black voters. They quietly acknowledge that Trump opens the general election phase of the campaign with a significant organizational and digital advantage.  They also report anecdotal evidence and internal polling suggesting that Trump's standing with younger black men, in particular, is rising.  Gallup found that Trump's approval rating stood at just 15% with black voters and 24% with Latinos immediately after he took office in 2017. Last month, the polling organization reported his approval with the same groups at 17% and 33% respectively.  Even a tiny improvement for Trump with such groups could prove devastating in their fight to defeat him this fall.  Trump eked out the narrowest of victories four years ago, relying on strong support from white working-class men and evangelicals, while Democrats failed to energize their own base of educated liberals, African Americans and Latinos.  Should he fail to improve among black and brown voters, his aggressive outreach planned for the weeks and months ahead could help him expand his coalition in other ways.  Democrats who studied Trump's Super Bowl ad with Johnson found that it tested better among white women than black voters. The president's party has struggled badly among suburban women in a series of elections since he took office, but it has yet to develop a cohesive message or strategy to reverse the trend.  During a discussion about the campaign's outreach to women, Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law and a campaign adviser, noted that some of the president's closest advisers are women. She also said he's been fighting to protect 'the sanctity of life' by opposing abortion.  Alice Marie Johnson has stayed in close contact with Trump's team. She attended two White House events in the days before the coronavirus outbreak exploded, and said she's not opposed to appearing in future ads.  'He's very compassionate with families,' Johnson said. \"I think that was why he put me in the Super Bowl ad \" it was me rejoining my family.'  'I know that I touched his heart,' she added.

At the heart of the case is the right of habeas corpus, embedded in the Constitution, which guarantees that people who are held by the government have the right to go to court asking to be released. A long line of Supreme Court cases protects that right — including for people who are in the United States illegally and even for those detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after 9/11.  Monday's case involved a Sri Lankan farmer — Vijayakumar Thuraissigiam — who was abducted from his fields, blindfolded by men in a white van, interrogated about his political activities, and beaten so badly with wooden sticks that he spent 11 days in a hospital.  Thuraissigiam is Tamil, an ethnic minority that has long been persecuted by the majority Sinhalese government in Sri Lanka. The beating he alleges follows a pattern of \"white van\" abductions of Tamils by security forces in Sri Lanka. After the beating, Thuraissigiam traveled for seven months to get to Mexico, where he crossed the border into the U.S., was arrested, and asked for political asylum.  A 2004 immigration policy targets any undocumented immigrant picked up within 100 miles of the border and within 14 days of entering the country for quick deportation. The Trump administration has sought to expand the deportation policy so that undocumented immigrants anywhere in the U.S can be picked up for any reason up and quickly deported up to two years after their arrival.  Thuraissigiam's case illustrates the speed of the expedited deportation proceedings that have become routine. Following a quick hearing with no lawyer present, an immigration officer denied Thuraissigiam's asylum claim — finding that he did not \"credibl[y] fear\" for his life if he were returned to his home country and therefore did not merit asylum. After a 13-minute hearing, an immigration judge — an executive branch officer, distinct from a traditional judge — upheld that decision. And so, a month after his arrival, Thuraissigiam was ordered deported back to Sri Lanka.  He filed a habeas petition alleging that the denial of his asylum claim was due to the immigration officer's failure to properly carry out the asylum interview. The district court ruled that even though Thuraissigiam had raised valid legal concerns, he was not entitled to have a judge review his case because he was subject to expedited removal.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, however, intervened. It ruled that under the U.S. Constitution Thuraissigiam has a right to have his asylum claim reviewed by the judiciary in order to ensure that, at the very least, legal errors were not made by the immigration officers who handled his case.  At the Supreme Court Monday, Thuraissigiam's lawyer, Lee Gelernt of the ACLU, told the justices that the case is of historic importance.  \"There has never been a time in the history of this country when a non-citizen could be forcibly removed and deported, especially where they're in danger, without any court at any time looking at whether the deportation is legal,\" Gelernt told NPR after arguments.  Inside the court, Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler, representing the Trump administration, told the justices that under the immigration statute, there is no right to judicial review.  \"Come on,\" interjected Justice Stephen Breyer. What if an immigration official \"behaved unlawfully,\" ruled against the asylum seeker \"for religious reasons\" ... would there really be no recourse for judicial review?  Justice Elena Kagan pointed out that \"what he's challenging is whether he's getting a fair hearing,\" not the final decision of whether he gets to stay.  Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked whether \"as a pure matter of law,\" if, for example, there was no interview conducted at all, could there be an appeal to a judge?  \"No,\" replied Kneedler. In writing the statute, Congress did not provide for habeas corpus relief in the federal courts, and \"Congress' judgement should count for something.\"  Justice Sotomayor shot back, \"Shouldn't this court count for something?\" The writ of habeas corpus is there \"to ensure that the executive acts according to law. What's left if you tell me there are laws\" but the courts can't review \"whether those laws are being followed.\"  Kneedler however, said that Congress designed the system to be \"quick screening.\" He argued that there are 9,000 rulings against asylum seekers each year, and a Supreme Court decision that would allow judicial review of those rulings would \"bog down the system.\"  When opposing counsel Galernt got up, however, he disputed that, noting that of those 9,000 cases where people were denied asylum, only 30 had sought judicial review under the Ninth Circuit's ruling that allowed such appeals.  Chief Justice John Roberts pointed out, however, that Thuraissigiam \"does not have a right to be to be in the United States.\"  \"That's beside the point,\" said Gelernt, habeas was put into the Constitution \"to ensure that the law is followed.\" In this context, he added, \"there has to be review at least for gross misapplication of the statute.\" And here, he said, \"no reasonable adjudicator\" would have seen this case as failing to meet the criteria for asylum.  Gelernt conceded that Congress and the president have \"enormous power in the immigration area.\" But, he noted, the Supreme Court has never allowed the political branches to \"remove a check on themselves.\"  A decision in the case is expected by summer.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:  The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments today on the Trump administration's policy to speed up deportations of people in the country illegally. The policy denies these people the right to ever go before a judge to make their case. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports.  NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: At the heart of today's case is the right of habeas corpus embedded in the Constitution. It guarantees people held by the government the right to go to court seeking their release. A long line of Supreme Court cases protects that right for people illegally in the United States, too, and even for those detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after 9/11.  Today's case involved a Sri Lankan farmer who was abducted from his field, blindfolded by men in a van, interrogated and beaten so badly with wooden sticks that he spent 11 days in hospital. Vijayakumar Thuraissigiam is Tamil, an ethnic minority that has long been persecuted by the majority Sinhalese government in Sri Lanka. After the beatings, Thuraissigiam traveled for seven months to get to Mexico, where he crossed the border into the U.S., was arrested and asked for political asylum.  A 2004 immigration policy targets for quick deportation any undocumented immigrant picked up within a hundred miles of the border and within 14 days of entering the country. The Trump administration has sought to expand the deportation policy so that undocumented immigrants detained anywhere in the U.S. can be picked up for any reason and quickly deported for up to two years after their arrival.  An immigration officer denied Thuraissigiam's asylum claim after a quick hearing with no lawyer. An immigration judge, also an executive branch officer, upheld the decision after a 13-minute hearing. And a month after his arrival, Thuraissigiam was ordered deported back to Sri Lanka. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, however, intervened. It ruled that under the U.S. Constitution, Thuraissigiam has a right to have his asylum claim reviewed by the judiciary in order to assure that, at the very least, legal errors were not made by the hearing officers who handled his case.  Today in the Supreme Court, lawyer Lee Gelernt of the ACLU, representing Thuraissigiam, told the justices that the case is historic. Here he is outside afterwards.  LEE GELERNT: There has never been a time in the history of this country when a noncitizen could be forcibly removed and deported, especially where they're in danger, without any court at any time looking at whether the deportation is legal.

Chief Justice Roberts - no immigrant has a right to be in the United States. Replied Gelernt, that's besides the point. The writ of habeas corpus was put into the Constitution to ensure that the law is followed. In this context, he added, there has to be review for gross misapplication of the statute.

WASHINGTON — In what was his final State of the Union before he again faces voters in November, President Donald Trump mostly shook off months of impeachment proceedings and delivered a speech with reelection in mind.  \"Our borders are secure. Our families are flourishing. Our values are renewed. Our pride is restored,\" he said. \"And for all these reasons, I say to the people of our great country, and to the members of Congress, the state of our union is stronger than ever before.\"  But this was no bipartisan affair, and the impeachment proceedings that are on track to conclude on Wednesday lent polarized iciness to the annual address.  At the outset, the president passed up Speaker Nancy Pelosi's offer to shake his hand. In return, Pelosi presented the president to the members of Congress without calling it her \"high privilege and distinct honor,\" as she did during the George W. Bush era. And as she was still on the dais after the speech, Pelosi methodically tore up a printed version of Trump's remarks that he had presented her.  Republican members greeted Trump with chants of, \"Four more years.\" Several Democratic members walked out on the speech. That group included U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, an Austin Democrat who later said in a statement that he hoped voters oust \"this self-serving, reckless president before he becomes a full-fledged tyrant.\"  Without mentioning President Obama's name, Trump framed the past three years as a success after what he characterized as troubled years under his predecessor. It was a posture with which the Obama administration officials and Congressional Democrats took issue.  The president's annual address to both chambers of Congress was at times aspirational — the president called his time in office \"the great American comeback.\" But it also painted a dark picture of illegal immigration in America.  Trump pushed for Republican policies, including school choice and construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall. One of the few moments of bipartisan applause in the chamber came when the president advocated for renewed public works projects and expanded rural broadband access.  Mirroring the partisan tone of the speech, Texans in Congress had split reactions to Trump's remarks, depending on their party affiliation.  Republican U.S. Rep. Kay Granger of Fort Worth lauded the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a new North American trade deal, that Trump recently signed into law.  \"President Trump’s optimistic vision for our country puts hardworking Americans first, and I was pleased to hear him outline his continued commitment to policies that promote a strong economy, secure our nation’s border, and modernize our great military to protect the American way of life,\" she said in a statement.  And Republican U.S. Rep. Bill Flores, R-Bryan, said on Twitter that the speech highlighted the \"great American comeback\" that has occurred since Trump took office.  \"Thanks to his leadership, hardworking American families are doing far better than at any time in recent decades,\" he said.  In an interview after the speech, Democratic U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro accused Trump of sowing fear with his remarks on immigration and giving Americans a \"false sense of security\" with his vows to keep building a border barrier.  \"You know, there were parts of it that were clearly meant as a pep rally for his base,\" Castro said. \"There were parts of it that were, I thought, powerful for the American people, like the reunion of the soldier and his family. That was wonderful to see. But he undercut himself by again, going back to division, which is what he always does.\"  In delivering the Spanish-language rebuttal to the president's speech from her hometown of El Paso, Democratic U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar was not subtle in prose or place.  In just more than 11 minutes, Escobar took aim at Trump and Republicans on issues she said not only affect her constituents, but impact the lives of Americans across the country: the economy, environment, health care and gun violence.  “In my state, the expansion of Medicaid would provide care for hundreds of thousands of Texans,” she said. “At the same time, Republicans across the country are actively fighting to dismantle benefits that save lives, working in the courts to eliminate every last protection of the Affordable Care Act, including protections for the 130 million people with pre-existing conditions.”  She delivered her remarks at El Paso’s Centro de Salud Familiar La Fe location in Segundo Barrio, a historical, blue-collar neighborhood that sits just blocks from the international bridge that connects Texas and Mexico.  “I feel like all of us are delivering this message on behalf of El Paso,” she told the crowd of about 150 spectators present to hear her pre-taped remarks. “I love you all so much and I cannot tell you how grateful I am that you’re spending your evening with us.”  Escobar was flanked by about two dozen guests who stood with her on stage, including two who were at the city’s Walmart that was shot up by a white supremacist who killed 22 people and injured dozens more last year. The alleged gunman posted a manifesto railing against a so-called Mexican invasion, and Escobar wasted no time in tying his words to President Trump.  “On August 3rd of last year, El Paso suffered from the deadliest targeted attack against Latinos in American history. A domestic terrorist confessed to driving over 10 hours to target Mexicans and immigrants,” she said. “Just before he began his killing spree, he posted his views online and used hateful language like the very words used by President Trump to describe immigrants and Latinos. That day, the killer took 22 innocent lives, injured dozens, and broke all of our hearts.”  Sam Manas contributed to this story.

Shifting the agency from within the Department of Homeland Security to the Treasury would require action from Congress, but President Trump is confident enough that he plans to include the Secret Service under the Treasury’s budget in his proposal expected Monday, according to five administration officials with knowledge of the move. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations.  The Department of Homeland Security’s intense focus on immigration has only added to the growing divide between what the Secret Service sees as its dual missions – protecting the president and investigating financial crime – and the mission of its parent department.  But there are strong concerns the Secret Service’s departure could lead to the eventual dismantling of DHS, which was formed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as a counterterrorism agency bringing together security agencies across the government.  The Secret Service is best known as the agency responsible for protecting the president, but its original purpose when it was formed in 1865 was to investigate financial crimes such as counterfeit money proliferating during the Civil War. It was housed under the Treasury until 2003, when it was transferred to the new Department of Homeland Security.  Only about half of the Secret Service’s budget is spent on protective services. It also has a robust cybercrime division, state-of-the-art forensic labs and a threat assessment center that studies how to mitigate and train against threats. The agency’s annual budget of about $2.3 billion would shift from one department to another under Trump’s proposal.  In the Trump era, DHS has been highly focused on immigration, one of the Republican president’s top priorities, leaving other agencies unrelated to immigration out of the spotlight.  “The biggest challenge has been the president’s immigration focus,” Rep. Bennie Thompson, the head of the House Homeland Security Committee, told the AP. “The immigration focus takes up a lot of the resources for DHS. It’s been very difficult for Secret Service to be fully funded. ”  Department of Homeland Security officials initially pushed back against shifting the Secret Service back to the Treasury, concerned it could spark an exodus from other agencies contained within DHS, a 240,000-person department that also includes disaster relief, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration, according to the officials. DHS referred questions to the White House.  The Secret Service is “part of a unique cohort that gets lost in the massive bureaucracy,” said Breanne Deppisch, who studies the topic for the Aspen Institute think tank.  Deppisch said she feared the news could be a blow to other non-immigration agencies at Homeland Security, specifically the newly formed Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, tasked with election security. She worried it could deepen recruitment problems at other agencies and lower morale, which is already low departmentwide.  It’s not the first time such a move has been considered in recent years. After a high-profile prostitution scandal in 2012 and other missteps, Democrats and Republicans in Congress debated whether the agency should be relocated, broken up or shrunk.  A feasibility study was completed last year from a working group of Homeland Security, the Treasury and the White House, and the results found that moving the Secret Service would help enhance collaboration in the Treasury and would put the Secret Service back on the map as a large law enforcement agency, though it could harm morale at Homeland Security.  “DHS employees, members of Congress and staff, the homeland security committee – may perceive a weakened DHS with the loss of Secret Service,” the working group wrote in the report. “Such a loss could open DHS up to additional reforms or reorganizations, perhaps even some involving the transfer or dismantling of other operating components, further weakening the department at a critical time in its development.”  The Secret Service would be the second largest agency at the Treasury after the Internal Revenue Service, which could result in more attention and a morale boost for staff, according to the report, initially published by The New York Times and obtained by the AP. It would give the Treasury back a law enforcement and investigative capability to protect financial infrastructure and payment systems.  Secret Service leadership recommended the move, according to the report.  “The Secret Service has been involved in discussions regarding the potential move and is appreciative of the active interest in advancing its integrated mission” according to an agency statement.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Fox Business this week that he expected legislation to be introduced soon.  “We think it will very much help us in combating money laundering and terrorist activities,” he said of the move.  He approached the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee with the proposal, and they were open to it. But it may not be that simple to convince lawmakers – not all senators with a stake in the agency voiced support, and some House Democrats are strongly against it.  Rep. Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said he recognized the challenges the agency faces in the current climate, but jumping ship isn’t the right answer and he opposed the move.  “From the standpoint of what they do, intelligence, analysis, and threat mitigation, they’re better situated within DHS,” he said.  Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein’s office said as part of the proposal she asked to include reports on the cost of presidential travel to include details of presidents’ families, too, to provide “greater transparency, accountability and oversight.”  Trump signaled a few weeks ago that he approved of the Secret Service transfer.  “The President and his administration support the bipartisan efforts of Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Dianne Feinstein to return the Secret Service to its historic home at the U.S. Department of the Treasury,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. “This transfer will improve the Secret Service’s ability to carry out its integrated, dual mission of protection and investigations.”  The head of a union representing Secret Service agents said he hadn’t seen the proposal.  The first presidential protection job for the agency came in 1894, when it started protecting President Grover Cleveland. Agents eventually began protecting other government officials including Cabinet members and presidential candidates.  Send questions/comments to the editors.

Research by campaign group the3million suggests more than one in 10 EU citizens and their relatives have been wrongly told to provide proof of settlement despite the fact that it is not required until after Britain leaves the EU and people have until June 2021 to apply to the scheme.  The findings, based on a survey of 3,171 EU nationals and their family members, reveal people have been asked for proof of their post-Brexit immigration status by recruiters, landlords, banks, GPs and hospitals, local councils and schools, among other agencies and public bodies.  The new report exposes cases where people had been told by employers that they would not go ahead with job offers until their application to the EU settlement scheme is concluded, and examples of people being denied healthcare and prevented from opening bank accounts.  One respondent said: “I’m working in the public sector and someone from HR said that are unable to form my permanent contract as my future is uncertain in the UK. They asked me to prove that I have applied for settled status.”  Another said they were trying to get on a list for council housing and had been strongly recommended to get settled status first, while a third respondent said they were unable to renew their driving license without proof of EU settlement.  Maike Bohn, co-founder of the3million, said the findings were a “sign of things to come”, adding: “Millions more people are being brought into the hostile environment and we’re already seeing the impact, even though the new immigration rules do not yet apply.  “It is likely to get worse when we go into the transition period on 31 January, because the very emphatic rhetoric about ‘getting Brexit done’ means many will assume proof of settled status is needed. Confusion and chaos is to be expected.”  Labour MP David Lammy said the way EU nationals had been treated since the 2016 referendum was a “disgrace”.  “Rather than reassuring our European friends, neighbours and relatives who contribute so much to our society, both Theresa May and Boris Johnson showed contempt by insulting them and using them as bargaining chips,” he added.  The findings come after the Home Office refused a plea to give EU citizens physical proof of their right to stay in the UK after Brexit – which campaigners say is needed in order to prevent “another Windrush”.  Mr Bohn accused Boris Johnson of “blowing hot and cold on EU citizens” and urged him to “rebuild trust through actions” including the provision of better.  The report also suggests that EU settlement applications were taking three times longer than Home Office stated, with respondents reporting having waited on average 15 days for an outcome, while the government saying it usually takes five working days. Nine per cent of respondents who had applied were still waiting for a decision.  It also indicated that many respondents believe they are not required to apply for settled status, with 29 per cent saying they had not applied and 7 per cent of these think they did not need to.  For Our Futures Sake speak to EU nationals who can't vote in the general election  Chai Patel, legal policy director at JCWI, called on ministers to scrap the hostile environment, warning that as long as it remains “this sort of discrimination will only increase”.  “With such an extraordinary lack of moral leadership under a government that continues to support the hostile environment for immigrants, it is no wonder that EU nationals are already facing additional barriers to living their lives in the UK,” he added.  A Home Office spokesperson said: “We value the contribution EU citizens make to our country and we want them to stay.

Lawmakers said they received a request on Thursday to reprogramme more than $3.8 billion from funding for the National Guard and weapons programs, setting the stage for a possible confrontation with Democrats.  Democratic aides said $1.5 billion would come from the National Guard, and the rest from funds for procurement, including the Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet programme, Lockheed C-130 transport aircraft, Boeing Co P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, and shipbuilding.  Congressional Democrats, who opposed Trump's past diversion of billions of dollars in military spending to the border wall project, said the decision was dangerous and misguided.  \"President Trump is once again disrespecting the separation of powers and endangering our security by raiding military resources to pay for his wasteful border wall,\" Democratic Representatives Nita Lowey, chairwoman of the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee, and Pete Visclosky, chairman of the Defence Appropriations subcommittee, said in a statement.   The criticism was bipartisan.  The top Republican on the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, Representative Mac Thornberry, said the move by the Pentagon was \"contrary to Congress’s constitutional authority.\"  A senior Pentagon official said U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper had approved about $3.8 billion in funding being diverted to build 177 miles (290 km) of border wall.  Last month, the Pentagon received a request from within the Trump administration to build roughly 270 miles (435 km) of wall on the border, which would have cost about $5.5 billion.  \"The transfer of funds is based on what the law allows and that the items to be funded are a higher priority than the items (from) which the funds were transferred,\" Robert Salesses, the deputy assistant secretary of defence for homeland defence integration, told Reuters.  The American Civil Liberties Union, or ACLU, said it would challenge the latest border wall transfer.  The Trump administration has vowed to build at least 400 miles (640 km) of wall along the border by November 2020, when Americans will vote for president. In his 2016 campaign, Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall. The Mexican government has consistently refused to do so.  Trump's hard-line immigration policies, particularly for immigrants who come across the southern border with Mexico, have been a signature of his political campaign and first term in the White House.

In New York, this movement moment has already helped produce real results for long-fought campaigns: we have already won major policy victories in the fight for police accountability, including the repeal of 50a (a police secrecy statute), the STAT Act (a data reporting bill), and special prosecutor legislation.  CityViews are readers’ opinions, not those of City Limits. Add your voice today!  But the criminalization of our communities continues. With Albany legislators slated to return next week, they must take further action to keep community members with their loved ones, and youth in their schools—not in cages. Legislators can and should continue to make progress towards reversing the criminalization of our communities by passing the Protect Our Courts Act and the Solutions not Suspensions Act, and repealing the Walking While Trans Ban.  On June 12th, Black and Brown communities celebrated a landmark victory with the repeal of 50a, for which we had been fighting for years, and finally won in the legislature in the wake of the killing of George Floyd. The next day, Governor Cuomo said, “You don’t need to protest, you won. You accomplished your goal.” Wrong. While we won important progress in Albany, our demands go much further. Our communities organized for years to make these victories possible, and we will continue to stand together against injustice.  Black and Brown Trans women are still being locked up for the mere fact of existing in public and walking through their communities. Black and Brown youth are still being forced into the school-to-prison and -deportation pipeline by police in schools and punitive discipline. And, with ICE resuming its activities as COVID-19 declines, immigrants are at risk of being detained for going to court to access due process.  No wonder that, the day after Cuomo’s tone-deaf statement, as many as 15,000 community members marched to declare that “Black Trans Lives Matter.” Black Trans women continue to take action because they remain at grave risk of abusive policing and discrimination in many forms. One particular statute, known as the Walking While Trans Ban, makes “loitering for the purposes of prostitution” a crime. The law is applied as a catch-all to criminalize trans women of color—often just for standing outside their home, walking to the grocery store or walking with friends. Of those targeted, 90 percent of those charged are Black and Brown. It’s time to finally repeal the Walking While Trans Ban.  Black and Brown youth have remained in the streets, as well. In late June, as activists were occupying a park outside of City Hall, youth from across the city laid a #PoliceFreeSchools banner on the City Hall steps and held a press conference to demand the removal of officers from schools. While New York City fell far short of these youth demands (as well as failing to defund the NYPD), Albany legislators have a role to play, too. For years, there have been enormous racial disparities in school discipline. Outside of New York City, Black students are 4.2 times more likely to be suspended than White students. In New York City, Black students are 5.5 times more likely to be suspended than White students. Legislators can begin to address this by passing the Solutions Not Suspensions Act, which would overhaul school discipline policies, including limiting suspensions and promoting restorative justice. The state must act to protect students from exclusionary discipline, which pushes them further away from their education. We must embrace solutions that keep students connected to their school communities and engaged in their education so they can return to safer schools that value their humanity.  Finally, as COVID-19 has subsided in New York, immigrant communities are seeing a resurgence of immigration enforcement activity. All too often, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have lurked at and around courthouses around the state to prey upon immigrants showing up for their court appearances. This has both terrorized immigrant community members trying to access the legal system and undermined due process across the state. While litigation has blocked the practice for now, legislators should take action to prohibit ICE from ever engaging in this dangerous practice again. A  The road to justice for Black, Brown, immigrant, and trans communities is long. We know that no single protest, or single piece of legislation, will ensure that we are treated with respect and dignity. But we will not stop demanding the end of the criminalization of our communities. And we expect our legislators and Governor Cuomo to hear us and continue passing legislation to help us get there.

Edward Foley has a nightmare. It’s a poli-sci horror tale. A professor of constitutional law and elections expert at The Ohio State University’s Moritz College of Law, Foley foresees a scenario for the coming election that could tear apart American democracy.  Peer ahead to election night and imagine a close contest between Donald Trump and the Democratic presidential nominee, so close that the results in Pennsylvania will decide the winner. As the evening proceeds, Trump is narrowly ahead in the Keystone State, with the news networks tallying the incoming votes. When 100 percent of the precincts report, Trump is up by 20,000 votes, and he tweets: “The race is over. Another four years to keep Making America Great Again.” But hold on. The next day—and in the days ahead—as the counting of absentee and provisional votes occurs in routine fashion, Trump’s lead declines. The election is being stolen, Trump proclaims. His devotees take to the streets. The final result comes in: The Democrat triumphs by several thousand votes. “THIS THEFT WILL NOT STAND,” Trump tweets, and he declares political war.  In a 55-page law review article published last year, Foley depicts in granular detail what could happen at this point, if Trump and the Republicans opt to challenge the Pennsylvania results. Here’s a spoiler: It’s a damn mess with no clear outcome. And this one case study of how the 2020 presidential race could become a disaster has caught the attention of academics, former government officials, and policy advocates who have been banding together in different forms to try to address the many ways the election might be disrupted or contested.  “We went from a world with an election crisis possible to one where there is an election crisis.”  One such group is the ominously named National Task Force on Election Crises, a bipartisan collection of experts who are plotting out potential calamities and exploring possible remedies before anything hits the fan. This outfit is not predicting chaos, but it has considered dozens of scenarios beyond the Pennsylvania standoff in which the election could go awry and yield chaos and, perhaps, no easy resolution. It’s hair-raising stuff, and the fact that a number of the nation’s leading experts on elections are alarmed (to varying degrees) about what might transpire in November is in itself frightening.  There are laws and constitutional provisions that cover the management of a presidential election, but Foley, in this one example (which could apply to states other than Pennsylvania), shows that these measures are profoundly inadequate for resolving the sort of dispute that he envisions. In his thought experiment, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania determines the Democratic candidate has won the state and certifies the Democratic slate of electors, sending that notification to Congress. But the GOP-controlled state legislature has other plans: It insists Trump is the true victor, and it forwards the Trump slate of electors to Congress. The House and Senate in early January must decide which slate to accept. (It is the new Congress elected during the November balloting that will be in charge, though Vice President Mike Pence would still at this stage be president of the Senate.) If the party makeup of the two chambers has not changed, the Senate, ruled by Republicans, could well accept the Trump slate, and the House, in Democratic hands, would presumably approve the Democratic candidate’s slate. In the meantime, there could be both state and federal court cases related to the competing slates, with the matter perhaps landing before the Supreme Court.  Foley teases all this out and describes the various court challenges and legal arguments each side could deploy. He points out that in 2016, Trump’s election-night lead in Pennsylvania of 67,951 ultimately dropped to 44,292. So it is not hard to envision that this time an apparent election night win could turn into a loss. In fact, this happened in several congressional races in 2018. Foley makes it plain that the path forward in such a circumstance is not self-evident. The Electoral Count Act of 1887, which governs the process for tallying votes within the Electoral College, is imprecise. Under this law, Republicans could even argue that the very existence of competing slates ought to invalidate Pennsylvania’s votes, if the Democratic candidate needs that state to win.  “It would not take an extraordinary calamity, like a foreign cyberattack, for there to be conditions enabling partisans to dispute the result,” Foley writes. “Instead, a dispute engulfing Congress could arise from a situation as routine as [a vote count shift]. Given this possibility, it is truly irresponsible that Congress has not attempted to eliminate—in advance of the 2020 election—the ambiguities that plague the Electoral Count Act.” In other words, the nation could be screwed.  Foley is hardly alone in forecasting a possible fiasco. In October 2018, shortly before the congressional midterm elections, Norman Ornstein, an expert on government and a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post that raised a simple question: “What do we do if a national election is disrupted?” Weeks earlier, Hurricane Michael had slammed into the Florida Panhandle, and Ornstein wondered what might happen should a natural disaster strike during an election. If a storm—or an earthquake or a volcano eruption or wildfires—prevented voting, what could be done? States can reschedule state elections, but federal contests cannot be postponed. “We have no Plan B to take the impact into account if a national election is disrupted,” Ornstein bemoaned. “There are no do-overs and no mechanism in place to ameliorate the effect.” And Ornstein had in mind much more than Mother Nature: “What if, for example, China or Russia knocks out the electrical grid in one region of the country on a presidential Election Day? A hundred or more electoral votes would be disrupted, leaving the election outcome unsettled (along with many House, Senate and other elections).”  Neither the US Constitution or any law offers a plan for a makeup election. And what would be fair? Rescheduling voting in those areas that went dark, though voters there would now know the results of the votes cast elsewhere? Or a new vote across the nation? And if the election was thrown to the House of Representatives to settle—without a full House, due to the disrupted elections—would the president picked by this body be considered legitimate? Ornstein noted there was “no easy answer” of how to address a major disruption. What was needed, he contended, was to move quickly on possible reforms “before an event happens.”  Around this time, a nonprofit group based in Washington, DC, called Protect Democracy was engaging in likeminded worrying. The organization was founded in early 2017 by former executive branch officials, many hailing from the Obama administration, with the aim, according to its website, “to prevent American Democracy from declining into a more authoritarian form of government.” The group has a progressive bent, but its advisers include conservative commentators Linda Chavez and Mona Charen and Matthew Dowd, the chief strategist for the 2004 Bush-Cheney campaign. In the fall of 2018, its officials posed a question: What would occur if there were an aggressive hack of a voting system that prompted serious uncertainty about the results? It could be an attack that causes some units to malfunction. Or a hack of registered voter databases that leads to significant voting problems on Election Day. What would come next? “It caused us to think that we’re not ready for that,” says Ian Bassin, a co-founder of Protect Democracy and a former associate counsel in the Obama White House. “Can we get together people who would be called on in an election crisis and try to develop a consensus?”  Protect Democracy assembled a crew of election and legal experts that now numbers several dozen and dubbed it the National Task Force on Election Crises. The task force includes Foley and Ornstein, as well as Michael Chertoff, the former secretary of homeland security who served in the Bush-Cheney administration, Lanhee Chen, the policy director for the 2012 Romney-Ryan campaign, Paul Rosenzweig, a deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security during the Bush-Cheney years, Michael Steele, a former GOP chair, María Teresa Kumar, president and CEO of the Voto Latino Foundation, and Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. The task force recently added Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. It held its first meeting in June 2019 at Georgetown University, with an ambitious four-point agenda: identify crises that could happen; derive best-case scenarios for addressing them; consider what could be done in advance to give those remedies a shot of succeeding; and weigh actions that could lessen the chances of a crisis.  As part of this process, Protect Democracy last year enlisted students at a Harvard law school clinic it runs to envision for the task force possible crises that could threaten the 2020 election. They cooked up 65 potential disasters—a list that was winnowed to the 15 crises deemed the most likely and most disconcerting. And that lineup was trimmed again. (In this culling process, the possibility of a pandemic was removed as a contender. It was not considered one of the more feasible disturbances.) These possible debacles were termed “Magellan scenarios” because they each involved uncharted waters. And the assortment has included the Foley scenario, natural disasters, a foreign attack on the power grid, a hack on voting systems, violence or the threat of violence interfering with people’s ability to vote, a state or federal official misusing emergency powers to mess with the election, the deployment of law enforcement or immigration enforcement at polling locations to intimidate voters, the Justice Department mounting politically motivated investigations or prosecutions of a candidate, and the refusal of a candidate to concede. The National Task Force on Election Crises began working through these scenarios, looking to see if it could reach agreement on the best ways to avoid these calamities and on how to respond should the worse come to pass.  “Trump is a symptom more than a cause of our election problems. But he has exacerbated things and brought us to a dangerous point.”  At first, the task force’s work was behind the scenes. There was no intent to publicize its existence or deliberations before the election. Its organizers were proceeding on a simple assumption: Should a crisis hit, the country might better be able to handle it if a group of experts of different political pedigrees could address the controversy at hand with a single voice. No doubt, in such a time, there would be a cacophony of outrage and opinions spreading across the media and through the national political debate. At what might be a perilous moment, the group, according to one participant, could be “the political anchor of conventional wisdom.” The theory was that the existence of a broad consensus on a key point—say, this group had already determined that an important part of the Electoral Count Act of 1887 should be read a certain way—could ease the way to a resolution and make it tougher for a bad-faith political actor to exploit the situation. For this plan to work, there was no need to reveal the group’s existence before the election went south.  Then the coronavirus struck. “We went from a world with an election crisis possible to one where there is an election crisis,” Bassin recalls.  The task force revealed itself in March. It started a Twitter account and put up a website, noting, “Disruptions to elections can come from natural disasters or human-made disasters such as cyber attacks or improper interference by elected officials. In any event, it’s critical to know the proper steps forward in dealing with a crisis to ensure a free and fair election.” The group began releasing materials on how states should handle elections in the time of a pandemic. It published a coronavirus guide for election officials, recommending they immediately start preparing for wide-scale voting by mail and make plans to provide safe voting (including curbside voting and early voting) and to communicate to voters about changes in voting procedures. It sent a letter to governors, secretaries of state, and state election directors urging them to “implement the Task Force’s recommendations, accelerate planning for the general election, and request additional funding from the federal government if necessary to fund the new initiatives your state will need to undertake for the November election.” The task force released a statement noting that the president cannot cancel a national election or change its date and that “under no circumstance can any president’s term be extended past noon on January 20th without amending the Constitution.”  Task force members, through several working groups, have continued to ponder what could go wrong on November 3, 2020, and what would be the right responses. “As we considered the scenarios, many of us had an instinct to deny the hypotheticals,” Bassin recalls. “We didn’t want to contemplate that these nightmares could happen. The lawyers in the group sought legal answers only to find that the law sometimes does not provide clear answers. In those cases, are there principles that can guide us toward a consensus? If so, forcing people to consider in advance what those are and what should happen seemed a better thing to do than to wait until a crisis strikes.”  In this realm of what-ifs, there is one huge X factor: Donald Trump. How could this group—or anyone—game out what he could do to destabilize the election? He has already proclaimed that the Democrats intend to “steal” the election from him. He has repeatedly decried an increase in mail-in voting, signaling he might not accept the results of such balloting. Last week, Trump, referring to expanded mail-in voting, proclaimed, “This will be, in my opinion, the most corrupt election in the history of our country. And we cannot let this happen.” Might he call on supporters to show up at voting locations as protesters or self-appointed poll observers? Might they do so on their own? Might some come armed, as did Trump devotees who descended on state Capitols to protest the coronavirus lockdown orders? What would happen if violence breaks out at polling stations on Election Day and voters cannot exercise their franchise?  “A few instances of violence erupt, and you can imagine Trump saying, ‘Send in the troops,'” Ornstein says in an interview. He adds that he loses sleep over “a million nightmare scenarios.” Yet Ornstein notes that there are some obvious steps to take in advance. One is that the media, especially the news networks and the Associated Press, must inform the public ahead of voting day that the results on election night might not be the final count—and that is not immediate cause for suspicion.  “Let’s say there is a hurricane in Florida, or a BLM protest in Oklahoma or a Boogaloo protest in Oakland interferes with voting, or a cyber hack takes down voting rolls in Durham, North Carolina. What do you do? If you game-play it out, you’re in a better position.”  There are plenty of early warning signs to prompt concern, Ornstein says. The Wisconsin and Georgia primaries this spring were marred by voting problems. Georgia polling stations could not handle the turn-out—which was far less than what is expected for November. Kentucky had similar problems. New York State has been unable to process its large number of absentee ballot requests. “If there is an uptick of COVID in the fall, counties and states may limit the number of polling places, especially in cities, which tend to be Democratic areas,” Ornstein remarks. “We could end up with all sorts of question marks.” He has called for making absentee ballots available at polling places on Election Day, in case of long lines and other disorder. Another important front, he points out, is enlisting the major social media outlets to do what they can to prevent the spread of election-related disinformation and any messages that could inspire violence or sabotage at polling paces. Ornstein also hopes the task force and others can pressure Congress to increase election funding for states and localities, especially those that will be working with new systems this fall. “Some states are used to votes by mail to come in at 5 to 6 percent of the full count,” he says. “What happens when you go from 5-to-6 percent to 60 percent?”  Paul Rosenzweig, a Republican (until 2017) who worked on voting security at the Department of Homeland Security and who now is a senior fellow at the R Street Institute, points out that Georgia, with its recent election, moved from 40,000 mail-in voters to 1.25 million. “Even the most competent and the most well-meaning government cannot choke down a change like that without disruption,” he says. He acknowledges that malicious actors do pose a threat to the 2020 election. Hackers could try to mess with voter databases or results. The Russians and Chinese or others could aim to use social media to increase political divisions. But he is most worried about the impact of changes related to the coronavirus pandemic. He refers to a colleague who is researching the affect of cleaning voting machines: “What if we use cleaning fluid on every machine after every voter? They are not designed to be cleaned 500 times a day.”  The natural uncertainty than comes with new voting procedures, Rosenzweig observes, can be exploited and exacerbated by anyone with a desire to undermine the legitimacy of the election: “We could see disinformation campaigns from the Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans, the Iranians, or Americans.” On a scale of 1 to 10, he says, his level of worry is now a 4 or 5, mainly because he believes there is still time to deal with potential pitfalls and problems “In August, I’ll either be at a 3 or a 7,” he says. In the months ahead, he hopes the task force can derive clear answers about the legal issues that could arise and provide assistance to local election officials. He says the group plans on war-gaming various Magellan scenarios: “Let’s say there is a hurricane in Florida, or a BLM protest in Oklahoma or a Boogaloo protest in Oakland interferes with voting, or a cyber hack takes down voting rolls in Durham, North Carolina. What do you do? If you game-play it out, you’re in a better position.” Ideally, he notes, the federal government would be running table-top exercises like these. As far as Rosenzweig knows, it isn’t. (Though Trump’s top intelligence officials have publicly stated that Russia is already intervening in the 2020 campaign, Trump has not taken any public steps to thwart the Kremlin’s covert interference.)  The ultimate goal, Rosenzweig says, is to position the task force so it can be provide a voice in any chaos that ensues: “With the right preparation, it can serve as a counterweight to claims the election was not free and fair, assuming we agree it was legitimate. One of the things I am struggling with is coming up with a feasible definition of what I consider a legitimate concern or not a legitimate concern.”  This spring, a separate group of academics—also including Foley and Ornstein—tried to get a jump on possible election chaos and contemplate how best to avoid or manage a crisis. This band was organized by Rick Hasen, a professor at UC Irvine School of Law, who in February published a book titled Election Meltdown: Dirty Tricks, Distrust, and the Threat to American Democracy. In this work, Hasen tracked how the confidence of Americans in the fairness of elections has been decreasing over the past 10 years, and he proposed several medium- and long-term reforms to address that. But, he realized, there was an immediate challenge posed by the current election. He rounded up two dozen experts on elections and in late February held a conference called “Can American Democracy Survive the 2020 Elections?”—just as the coronavirus pandemic was striking.  In a report issued in April, Hasen’s ad hoc committee presented 14 recommendations, some of which overlap with the ongoing work of the task force. It calls for states to improve their procedures for handling absentee and provisional ballots and to develop robust plans for voting during a coronavirus spike. It urges legal experts to resolve the ambiguities of the Electoral Count Act before any disputes occur. Media outlets, it notes, should prepare Americans to be patient for final results. Paper ballots ought to be maximized. “Social media companies have a unique responsibility to prevent the use of their platforms for efforts that would suppress votes through the spread of misinformation about voting,” the report says. (Hasen fears a last-minute barrage of disinformation falsely claiming polling places are being moved because of COVID-19.) This is a list of well-founded should-do’s that included increasing federal assistance for the coming election from $400 million to $2 billion.  One question is who is listening to the concerned experts of the task force and Hasen’s committee. Republicans in Congress so far do not seem eager to spend more money on election management and security. Perhaps the media and social media companies can be nudged in the right directions. But given Trump’s past and present comments—when he thought he might lose the 2016 election, he claimed it was being “rigged”—he obviously has no interest in promoting or following any of these recommendations. “Trump is a symptom more than a cause of our election problems,” Hasen says. “But he has exacerbated things and brought us to a dangerous point.”  Bassin notes that in the weeks and months ahead, the National Election Crisis Task Force will press to build consensus among its experts regarding what could—or should—be done in the assorted break-glass situations. But as this prep work is done, the experts who fear electoral hell breaking loose in November share one hope: The election is not close. A landslide could surmount particular problems that occur on Election Day. If votes are not cast or counted in a particular spot, but the amount of such votes is not decisive, then it will be harder for anyone to claim (justifiably) the election results are not sound. Ornstein frequently talks to election officials, and they share the same mantra; “Dear, Lord, please let it be a landslide.” He explains, “They don’t want to be in a situations where it’s close.” The narrower the race, the greater the likelihood a disruption could affect (or be perceived as affecting) the outcome. “The election has to go smoothly enough,” Hasen says. “If it’s not particularly close, we will still have problems, but I hope these are problems that don’t lead to questions of legitimacy. If it is very close, we’re in big trouble.”  The policy wonks and advocates anxious about the tumult that could erupt on Election Day are hoping discussions and debates before the fact can help the country navigate a crisis. “Every election has errors, but most are not of a sufficient scale to call into question the results,” Rosenzweig says. “In this environment, irregularities become magnified and people are increasingly skeptical. So the question is whether we can be effective in helping.” Speaking for himself and not the task force, Rosenzweig notes there are no guarantees that a bipartisan and nonpartisan collection of knowledgable and somber-minded experts will be able to save the nation from political turmoil. “We’re assuming the national political discussion will be highly dysfunctional, and we are assuming this group alone won’t be able to break through the noise,” he comments. “Others in the world of media and politics will have to be brought in. And even then maybe there will be too much noise. How much can we break through and move the needle? If there is a broken election and a broken populace, there is no magical mechanism.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 69, "positive": 146, "negative": 38, "disgust": 11, "joy": 6, "anger": 73, "surprise": 14, "fear": 32, "trust": 37}, "metadata": ["reporting", "coronavirus", "edward", "professor", "election", "american", "donald", "trump", "democratic", "presidential", "pennsylvania", "america", "republicans", "advocates", "crisis", "bipartisan", "dozens", "chaos", "senate", "congress", "approve", "supreme", "challenges", "arguments", "ultimately", "op-ed", "washington", "michael", "china", "reforms", "nonprofit", "obama", "progressive", "conservative", "matthew", "posed", "aggressive", "counsel", "homeland", "deputy", "gop", "ceo", "latino", "university", "crises", "addressing", "students", "deemed", "pandemic", "termed", "violence", "immigration", "motivated", "agreement", "media", "tougher", "twitter", "ensure", "urging", "funding", "undertake", "cancel", "term", "repeatedly", "supporters", "inform", "wisconsin", "georgia", "primaries", "covid", "messages", "chinese", "refers", "ongoing", "platforms", "claiming", "well-founded", "debates", "nonpartisan"]}, {"text": "In February 2019, a friend and I — who dubbed ourselves the @vanmigos — embarked on a journey to explore the Americas in our camper van, affectionately named Vanessa.  Vanessa and I had landed back in Guatemala when the COVID-19 pandemic pressed pause on the world, resulting in a countrywide lockdown and strict curfews.  In an effort to get home to Canada, I traversed three countries over eight days in a journey filled with roadblocks, both literal and figurative.  Though the week was filled with challenges, it taught me seven valuable lessons about travel (such as learn the language and have your documents in order) and life (most importantly, count your blessings).  Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.  Eight days. More than 5,000 kilometers. Numerous police checkpoints, three border crossings, two flat tires, and one police shakedown.  These are the brass tacks of my journey home to Canada from Guatemala in a van during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, a road trip that ended up teaching me seven important lessons about travel and life.  A friend and I — who dubbed ourselves the @vanmigos on Instagram — originally began our journey in February 2019 when we set out to explore Central and South America in our 1988 Chevy Getaway Van, affectionately known as Vanessa.  Fully loaded with a fridge, sink, and two beds, Vanessa was the perfect fit for two single lads ready for the adventure of a lifetime.  The vanmigos alongside Vanessa at our alma mater Western University on our way out of Canada. Colin Mills @vanmigos  I wasn't willing to leave Vanessa — my home — behind  After traversing 10 countries over 15 months and losing my original \"vanmigo\" along the way, Vanessa and I had landed back in Guatemala when the COVID-19 pandemic pressed pause on the world.  I had begun a work trade at Guatemala's Fungi Academy when news of the virus spread. I was extremely lucky to have arrived at my destination on Lake Atitlán when I did, as only a week prior I had been gallivanting solo around El Salvador.  Guatemala closed its borders on March 11. The government restricted travel between towns, and a curfew was enforced from 4 p.m. to 4 a.m.  Though a repatriation flight was one of many options to consider, there was no way I was leaving Vanessa — my home — in Guatemala.  Surrounded by beauty with all of my needs met, I decided to hunker down and see how things played out.  I can think of worse places to be locked down than Lake Atitlán, Guatemala. Colin Mills @vanmigos  I laid low for 2 months before deciding to attempt the trip  After two months of laying low surrounded by stunning views, beautiful people, and an abundance of resources, I decided it was time to attempt the trip home.  The challenge? The two countries in my way — Mexico and the US — had some of the highest infection rates of the virus at the time. Luckily, my fellow Canadians Crystal Drinkwalter and Jazmyn Canning, or the @vanwives, had completed the same trip only weeks prior, and in talking to them I was assured it was smooth sailing — or at least it had been for them.  Armed with excitement, uncertainty, and a letter from our respective embassies, I and my new Danish copilot, Alex, — whom I had met on arrival to the Fungi Academy — headed into the unknown toward Mexico.  Our governments told us to cross at the Tecún Umán border, and not the nearby El Carmen crossing. There, locals on the Mexican side had put up roadblocks to prevent foreign tourists from entering. There was an immense fear of tourists spreading the virus because of the outbreaks that were widespread in Europe at the time.  Guatemalan military personnel speak with Mexican border officials at El Carmen border. Colin Mills @vanmigos  Lesson 1: Learn the native tongue  Miscommunication led to us spending 24 hours at the Guatemalan border.  The confusion began when a local police officer pulled us over only minutes from the border to tell us it was closed. He suggested trying El Carmen, which went directly against our government intel. After some discussion, we decided to heed the officer's advice and try our luck at El Carmen, which was a big mistake.  Much like a person needs a visa, a vehicle requires a permit to travel in foreign countries. With the way the El Carmen border is set up, we had to pass through the vehicle-permit office before going through immigration and on to Mexico. Everything seemed copacetic as I canceled Vanessa's permit and continued on to immigration.  It was soon clear the employees in the vehicle-import office were not informed of the roadblocks in Mexico. The Guatemalan immigration officers urged us to speak with the Mexican border before proceeding to be stamped out of Guatemala and barred from reentry.  The Mexican officials were fine with admitting us to the country but informed us it was not safe for two white men to pass through this border.  I realized I would have been lost without Alex's ability to communicate with the border officials, which reinforced my need to become fluent in Spanish.  We were unable to cross into Mexico or backtrack to Guatemala in an unpermitted vehicle and stuck in no-man's-land in the middle of a downpour. Good thing Vanessa doubles as a home.  My copilot, Alex, during our night on no-man's-land. Colin Mills @vanmigos  Lesson 2: Get your information from the right source  Though my previous permit was still valid, for reasons unknown, the vehicle-import office said they could not issue us a new one to travel back to the Tecún Umán border. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, we decided to take our chances and drive through Guatemala with an \"illegal\" vehicle.  We thought we had a better chance explaining the situation to roadside officials than getting help from the import office. We made the hour drive without a hitch, and after a few more hours of sweet-talking from Alex, we were finally allowed to leave the country.  In hindsight, we could have saved a lot of time and avoided major roadblocks had we ignored the police officer's advice. Canceling Vanessa's permit without leaving the country caused a lot of confusion and no constructive solutions.  I was finally granted permission to leave Guatemala after 24 hours of trying. Colin Mills @vanmigos  Lesson 3: Have your documents in order  There was no way entering Mexico could be as difficult, right? Wrong.  The border agents pointed out that my license plates had expired in January 2019. I had been aware of this since departing Canada, but it had never been an issue when obtaining a vehicle permit to any of the 10 countries we visited previously — including Mexico the year prior — so why was it a problem now?  Utterly confused, I begged the agents to stop Vanessa from being embargoed. With the Guatemalan border closed, there was only one direction we could go.  COVID-19 signs at the border — the new normal. Colin Mills @vanmigos  After further negotiations by my Spanish-speaking Danish copilot, Vanessa was eventually granted entry on the condition I not leave the border town. After two nights and hours of more negotiations, I was finally granted a permit.  Days later, another van lifer informed me he had run into similar issues at this border. Instead of getting the required paperwork, he forged a current plate sticker, and the Mexican authorities didn't blink an eye.  Lesson 4: Have a reliable spare time  My copilot was on a flight back to Europe, and it was time to drive miles through Mexico. After I saw some amazing vistas and familiar places, everything had been smooth sailing on the road to the US. That is, until my final day in the country.  It started out rocky when I was pulled over by police officers (for the second time that morning) who demanded money from me for exceeding the speed limit by 10 kph. A few hours later, I had missed a turn and was backtracking when I hit a bump, and Vanessa's rear tire exploded.  This is exactly the place you don't want to get a flat tire. Colin Mills @vanmigos  Northern Mexico is constantly under an \"avoid all unnecessary travel\" advisory for foreigners. There I was, a solo tourist with a flat tire in the middle of nowhere with no cell service and few resources. It was the exact situation your parents worry about on a trip like this and exactly why I didn't tell them I had left the safe confines of my home in Guatemala.  Though a few cars passed while I changed my tire (and lost two kilos of water weight in the heat), locals paid no attention to me. With an underinflated cracked spare tire, I continued on my journey with hopes it would carry me to the next town. Unsurprisingly, my hopes proved futile.  Lesson 5: Have faith in humanity  Luckily, when my spare tire disintegrated, I was back on the main road within reach of civilization. Within minutes, I was able to flag down two local men in a truck and explain my situation in broken Spanish with the help of Google Translate. Gilberto was the driver's name. An older soft-spoken man in a cowboy hat became my savior and took two hours out of his day to drive me around town in an effort to solve my problems.  Me in the back of Gilberto's truck. Colin Mills @vanmigos  During my entire journey, I had people continually asking: \"Aren't you afraid of being robbed (or worse) while driving through Central America?\" Yet here I was, stranded in what is deemed one of the most dangerous parts of Mexico, and all I encountered were curious strangers eager to help and extend their hospitality.  If you avoid big cities and wander off the beaten path of the tourist traps, you'll soon discover a universal truth: We are wired to help, not harm.  After a long day filled with excitement, I finally crossed into the US. The comforts of the Motel 6 felt like the Shangri-La after the trials of Latin America.  Lesson 6: Set goals, not plans  One of the biggest lessons I learned from COVID-19 was that when you make plans, life happens.  The final two months of my return trip was the only time I had made a schedule during my travels. Reunions with friends, a music festival, playoff hockey games — I was going out with a bang.  But COVID-19 had other plans.  Still, I found that once I released the disappointments of all I had missed, I discovered the joys of all that surrounded me.  Me with Nala the puppy, my main joy while staying at the Fungi Academy. Colin Mills @vanmigos  Lesson 7: Count your blessings  Being surrounded by the English language and advertisements for antidepressants provided me with a new kind of culture shock when I reentered the US. Thankfully, the next few days were relatively uneventful as I raced back to my homeland.  Three days later, and with Vanessa in one piece, I surprised my parents (at a safe distance) on their doorstep.  Vanessa safe and sound back in Canada. Colin Mills @vanmigos  Though it was a long and somewhat arduous journey, I realized how lucky I was that things didn't turn out worse.  I was at the Fungi Academy when the pandemic hit, secured with essential resources and surrounded by beautiful people.  I had Alex, my copilot, to support me throughout my journey (especially with his Spanish skills).  Vanessa avoided embargo and got me home safely.  I experienced the unconditional kindness of Gilberto.  When the flat tires hit, I was close to a town where I could replace them, which is no small feat in rural Mexico.  The Canadian border agents made my reentry to the country as smooth as possible.  I was amazed by the generosity of family and friends now that I'm home.  The final and most important lesson I learned? Always count your blessings.

Francis’ new encyclical, released Sunday with the title “Fratelli Tutti” (“Brothers All”), wasn’t written as commentary on a specific country’s politics and doesn’t explicitly mention Trump. But given the letter’s sharp rebuke of “violent nationalism,” selfish tribalism, and “trickle-down” economic theory, some Catholics reading the letter from a U.S. context believe it has implications for the faithful as they face the 2020 presidential election. “This encyclical challenges Catholics across the ideological spectrum with its call for a better kind of politics that puts the common good at the center of our debates,” said John Gehring, Catholic program director for the advocacy group Faith in Public Life Action. “But I do read the pope’s sharp criticism of nationalist trends and anti-immigrant populism as a critique of Trump’s ‘America First’ agenda.” In the encyclical, the Argentine pontiff lamented how fractured society has become and criticized the way that “hyperbole, extremism and polarization have become political tools.” He bemoaned the fact that some political leaders speak crudely with impunity, in ways that just a few years ago would have meant the “loss of universal respect.” He suggested that free-market capitalism and trickle-down economic policies have failed and encouraged people to combat the “structural” causes of poverty and inequality. Francis decried the xenophobia and “aggressive nationalism” bubbling up in certain countries and warned against the temptation to “raise walls, walls in the heart, walls on the land.”  Vatican Pool via Getty Images Pope Francis signs his new encyclical in front of St. Francis' tomb on Oct. 3, 2020, in Assisi, Italy. On the anniversary of the saint's death, Pope Francis celebrated Mass and signed his latest papal letter, \"Fratelli Tutti.\"  While presenting his vision for a world where people truly care for each other, Francis called on countries to “welcome, protect, promote and integrate” migrants fleeing humanitarian crises. People in some host countries are fearful of migrants and forget that they possess the same intrinsic dignity as any other human being, the pope wrote. “For Christians, this way of thinking and acting is unacceptable, since it sets certain political preferences above deep convictions of our faith: the inalienable dignity of each human person regardless of origin, race or religion, and the supreme law of fraternal love,” he wrote. Gehring said he found it “revealing” that the “small but vocal chorus” of Catholic bishops who have publicly diminished Democratic candidate Joe Biden’s Catholic faith, as well as pro-Trump Catholic advocacy groups have said little about the encyclical, which is considered the most authoritative form of teaching a pope can give. “The pope is offering a broad analysis that opposes trickle-down economics, expands the definition of what it means to be ‘pro-life,’ and rejects nativist nationalism as un-Christian,” Gehring said. “None of that is particularly useful for the electoral goals of many on the Catholic right.”  Pope Francis didn’t write a political manifesto, but he knows that challenging nationalist leaders who prey on fear and racism will help frame this as a moral issue in the election. — John Gehring (@gehringdc) October 5, 2020  For Sister Simone Campbell, executive director of the Catholic advocacy group NETWORK, Francis’ encyclical was an indictment of “rampant individualism, ‘got-you’ politics and economic exploitation.” “[America’s] elected leaders have failed in their responsibility to care for the least among us, with millions of Americans worried about getting sick, finding their next meal, or paying rent,” Campbell tweeted. “These politicians - notably in the Senate - have failed to give communities ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic the resources they need to survive. This is a failure in moral leadership and Catholics cannot stand for it.”  As I read through #FratelliTutti, I am struck that @Pontifex is sending a simple but jarring message to our world: We must move beyond continuous divisiveness and come together to build a world worthy of all God's children. His words are an indictment on rampant individualism, — Sr. Simone Campbell (@sr_simone) October 4, 2020  (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) Pope Francis greets Egypt's Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb after an interfaith meeting in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on Feb. 4, 2019. Francis said he was \"particularly encouraged\" by the imam while writing \"Fratelli Tutti.\"  Kate Ward, a theological ethicist at Marquette University, told HuffPost that Francis’ determination to reach across religious beliefs comes through clearly in “Fratelli Tutti.” “He is clearly determined that religious belief, or lack thereof, won’t be an obstacle to fraternity and social friendship on his watch,” Ward said of the pope. The document also contains a “challenge to anyone who’s tempted to conduct their life in society along aggressive lines, viewing others as enemies and inciting violence.” “President Trump seems to be pretty gleeful about his division of people into those who are with him, and those who are enemies. That is a behavior this document really condemns,” Ward said. In the past, Francis has challenged Catholics to treat their concern for the lives of the poor, sick, and marginalized as “equally sacred” as the “unborn.” The pope restated the church’s longstanding opposition to abortion in the encyclical, but did so while discussing other groups he believes should be protected ― the poor, disabled, elderly, and victims of human trafficking. E.J. Dionne Jr., a columnist for The Washington Post who identifies as Catholic, pointed out in an op-ed on Sunday that the word “abortion” doesn’t appear in the document, but that Francis included 12 references to the death penalty, which the pontiff claimed is “inadmissible” in all cases. This clear condemnation of the death penalty comes less than two weeks after one of the most prominent Catholics in the Trump administration, Attorney General William Barr, received a special award at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast ― despite the fact that Barr cleared the way for the federal government to resume capital punishment. Dionne wrote that it will be hard for Americans to read “Fratelli Tutti” outside the context of the presidential campaign. “The themes of his encyclical ... will make it much harder for conservative and right-wing Catholics to insist that the only orthodox vote is for Trump,” he wrote.  (Photo by Franco Origlia/Getty Images) In \"Fratelli Tutti,\" Pope Francis presents his vision for a world where people truly care for and protect each other.  Ultimately, the biggest challenge for all U.S. Catholics is Francis’ call for dialogue and acceptance of others’ differences, Ward said ― something she believes Americans have trouble with. “We want there to be good and bad characters in the drama, and there are only two sides and you’re either on ours or you’re on the bad side,” she said. “[Pope Francis] envisions a society of not binomial difference, but true plurality, where our discussion about what we can do to help the excluded starts from allowing others ‘to be themselves and be different.’” “For me, it is just a balm to hear Francis diagnosing our hurting world so clearly and saying that it’s possible we can all do better,” she added.

A divided 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued the decision late Wednesday, reversing a lower court order that stopped Trump from using $3.6 billion in U.S Defense Department money to construct the long-promised border wall.  The court noted that in July, the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a similar freeze on a separate source of military funding that Trump would like to use to pay for border barriers.  \"The Government is entitled to the same relief here,\" wrote the three-judge panel in the opinion.  On Thursday, the White House welcomed the court's action, calling the nationwide injunction put in place by the lower court \"illegitimate.\"  \"This is a victory for the rule of law. We are committed to keeping our borders secure, and we will finish the wall,\" said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.  Opponents say pulling money that was approved by Congress for other military projects in order to pay for border wall construction is an abuse of power.  Administration officials insist the maneuver became legal after Trump declared a national emergency along the southern border in February 2019. Under the declaration, Trump officials say, they have the right to reallocate military construction funding for more urgent projects, such as the 450 miles of border wall that Trump says he wants built by the end of the year.  When the president declared the national emergency over border security, he ordered federal agencies to find $6.7 billion in funding from other government projects to finance construction. The declaration also created a path to another source of border wall funding: money collected in drug interdiction efforts.  In essence, Trump's declaration enabled him to draw billions more dollars beyond the $1.3 billion that Congress specifically authorized for border wall funding. Trump had previously requested $5.7 billion from lawmakers, but Democrats balked at the price tag.  In the 2020 spending package passed in December, Congress maintained border wall funding at $1.3 billion, far below Trump's request, which he had upped to $8.6 billion.  White House officials are hopeful that drawing funds from other projects appropriated by Congress will raise enough money to pay for the wall.  Critics highlight how then-candidate Trump often declared ahead of the 2016 presidential election that Mexico would pay for the border wall.  Building a wall along the border with Mexico was one of the central proposals of his immigration plan when running for president, and it is a policy the president still often cites to fire up crowds at rallies.  Trump tapped his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, to help speed up completion of the wall, but the project has been plagued by delay.  And protracted legal battles are not the only thing slowing down construction. The government has found the process of seizing private land for the border wall to be vexing, leading critics to question whether Trump will get anywhere near those hoped-for 450 miles of new border barriers.  Lawyers for El Paso County and the Border Network for Human Rights, who originally sued over the controversial funding mechanism, suggested that the legal fight isn't over.  \"We're confident the district court's ruling that the president can't usurp Congress's power on this spending decision is correct,\" said Kristy Parker, a lawyer for the Protect Democracy Project, which is representing groups that sued the administration.  \"Even though border wall construction can move forward for now, we expect that in the end, the people of El Paso and the border community will prevail,\" Parker said.  On Thursday, Trump sent out a victorious tweet following the appeal court's order:  \"The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals just reversed a lower court decision & gave us the go ahead to build one of the largest sections of the desperately needed Southern Border Wall, Four Billion Dollars. Entire Wall is under construction or getting ready to start!\"  NPR's John Burnett contributed to this report.

We discover that Trump mused about building a moat with alligators at the southern border to fend off immigrants. (Yes, alligators. And yes, a moat.) We realize that senior aides steal sensitive documents off the president’s desk, hoping he will forget about them (which he does). We are told that multiple senior officials almost quit at the same time (but didn’t). We learn that Trump and the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Un, exchanged letters so gushing that a reporter deemed them “almost romantic” in their prose. (“I’m the only one he smiles with,” Trump told Bob Woodward of his pen pal, in Rage.) And we watch as the president struggles to read portions of the Constitution out loud, stumbling over the words and complaining that they sound-- metaphor alert!-- like a foreign language to him.  I believe it. I believe all of it and more. That’s the trouble with writing about the Trump White House, and reading about it too: The lunacy is appalling yet unsurprising, wholly unpresidential yet entirely on-brand. The president’s COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization last weekend are a perfect distillation of Trumpian chaos, packed with misinformation and contradiction, national-security risks and constitutional implications, and all with the man himself commanding every last speck of attention. When he needs oxygen, so do we. When his temperature rises, the nation’s does too.  ...Trump, of course, has loathed the Chaos Chronicles since the beginning. “I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos-- chaos,” the president complained during a White House news conference less than a month into his term. “Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine.” No, it is the exact opposite of the exact opposite; on this score, the scribes of the Trump era are more credible than the president. So Trump goes on Twitter tirades about these books, only boosting their sales and confirming their narratives. For publishers, a Trump tweetstorm is a key marketing objective.  Yet White House chaos is not the full story, and it should certainly not be the main story. While well-sourced reports and insider memoirs provide a vital historical record, the books that tell us what the chaos means and why it matters are most needed, even if not always the most memorable. When the fire dies out and the fury subsides, what is the true American carnage wrought by and in the Trump White House? If these volumes are any indication, it is the decline of America’s preparedness for truly complex crises-- ones that can’t be intimidated on Twitter, wished away as “fake news,” or redrawn with a Sharpie. It is the remaking, to lasting detriment, of the limits and powers of the American presidency, and the degrading of our expectations for-- and devotion to-- public service. And it is the erosion not of personal decorum or policy process, though there is plenty of that, but of the democratic values to which the country should aspire.  In the Chaos Chronicles calendar, July 20, 2017, is circled in red. That morning was the infamous briefing in “the Tank,” a high-level Pentagon affair with Cabinet secretaries, top White House advisers, and the commander in chief himself, the most dramatized and dissected meeting of the Trump presidency. Think of President John F. Kennedy’s Executive Committee sessions during the Cuban missile crisis-- but instead of worrying about Nikita Khrushchev and Fidel Castro, the assembled advisers are freaking out about their own guy.  At this gathering, Defense Secretary James Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and the economic adviser Gary Cohn-- some of Trump’s so-called adults in the room, all long since departed from the administration-- hope to tutor the president on the benefits of international alliances and military deployments. The attempt backfires spectacularly, not because their arguments are invalid but because Trump’s beliefs about how the world works have been set for decades, and winning the White House by campaigning on them did little to change his mind.  Some of the best-known and best-selling books on the Trump White House, such as Woodward’s Fear and Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig’s A Very Stable Genius, capture the scene with cinematic sweep and detail. Woodward devotes nine pages to the Pentagon meeting; Rucker and Leonnig go to 11. The former Mattis speechwriter Guy Snodgrass, who witnessed the briefing from an adjoining room, spends more than a chapter on it in Holding the Line. In his memoir, Team of Vipers, the former Trump communications aide Cliff Sims describes the president’s mood when he returned to the White House that day. (Spoiler: Trump was psyched.) The day’s meeting provided the kind of scene that strokes the erogenous zones of every political junkie. Generals! The president! Cursing! A clash of worldviews!  ...Together, the various accounts offer an almost running transcript of the briefing. Trump derides NATO as worthless, free trade as a scam, and Afghanistan as a “loser war,” Rucker and Leonnig report. “You’re all losers. You don’t know how to win anymore,” he tells the assembled officials, who include the four-star Mattis and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “I wouldn’t go to war with you people,” Trump adds. Tillerson is the only official who comes off well in this scene in A Very Stable Genius, challenging the president’s suggestion that U.S. troops should defend allies only if those countries pay up. (After the meeting, the secretary of state delivers the sound bite heard round the world, dismissing Trump as a “fucking moron.”) Woodward recounts how the president both trashes the notion of a new strategy for the war in Afghanistan (“You don’t need a strategy to kill people,” Trump reasons) and counters Cohn’s point that trade deficits can be good for the economy (“I don’t want to hear that. It’s all bullshit!”).  In Fear, the meeting is summed up in classic Woodwardian style, with a written summary by an unnamed official who spoke with people in attendance: “It seems clear that many of the president’s senior advisers, especially those in the national security realm, are extremely concerned with his erratic nature, his relative ignorance, his inability to learn, as well as what they consider his dangerous views.”  In other words, they feared what they already knew: They feared the very habits and impulses that had prompted them to hold the briefing in the first place. Trump is who they thought he was.  Multiple other people attended the meeting, including Vice President Mike Pence and the senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, and the accounts reflect various sources and perspectives. Even so, many of the Chaos Chronicles showcase the point of view of Steve Bannon, the ex–Breitbart News honcho who served as chief executive of the Trump campaign, the candidate’s nationalist muse, and, later, White House strategist. Bannon’s inner monologue sets up key moments in the meeting and helps guide the story. In Woodward’s account: “This is going to be fun, Bannon thought, as Mattis made the case that the organizing principles of the past were still workable and necessary.” When Tillerson argues that postwar alliances have kept international peace for decades, readers of Fear learn that “it was more of the old world order to Bannon: expensive, limitless engagements.” In A Very Stable Genius, Bannon’s musings are saucier: “Oh, baby, this is going to be fucking wild,” he thinks as the festivities kick off.  When Trump returns to the White House, he and Bannon exult over their performance. “Steve, Steve, that was spectacular,” the president says, according to Sims’s Team of Vipers. “We had them on the ropes. Rex didn’t have any idea what to say.” Bannon dismisses Tillerson as “totally establishment in his thinking,” and the president latches onto the phrase, as though it is some brilliant new formulation. “That’s the perfect way to put it: completely and totally establishment,” Trump responds. That moment showed Bannon “at the height of his power,” Sims writes.  The next month, Bannon would be out, fired by the new White House chief of staff, John Kelly. But much of the most dramatic material in the Chaos Chronicles transpires when Bannon still held sway with both the president and the journalists covering him. Far more than in any other volume, Bannon is the spirit animal of Wolff ’s Fire and Fury, which cites him so often that the book has a “by Steve Bannon, as told to Michael Wolff ” vibe. (One irony: Wolff whiffs on the Tank meeting, even writing about inconsequential happenings on the same day.) “Interactions with Bannon often had an almost cinematic quality to them, as if he were playing out a part for a camera in the corner capturing his every utterance,” Sims writes in Team of Vipers. He’s right. Books need stories, and Bannon may have been the most influential narrator of the early Trump era.  The trope of the genius campaign adviser is ingrained in Washington journalism, Joshua Green notes in Devil’s Bargain, his best seller on the Trump-Bannon relationship that came out in the summer of 2017, when Bannon’s star was at its brightest. Bannon deliberately cultivated the image of a big thinker, Green writes, one who was “able to make sense of the world and divine where it was heading.” In addition, he was a talented storyteller “in the Irish comic tradition,” Green notes, and candidate Trump fell for the grift. “He loved how Bannon, an avid reader of history and military biographies, fitted Trump’s outsider campaign into the broader sweep of history.”  The bargain at the heart of Green’s account is that Bannon’s hard-right nationalism and Breitbart hordes would ally with Trump’s grievance politics to win the White House-- at which point the new administration would enact an anti-trade, anti-immigrant, anti-interventionist agenda. (In a delightful aside, Woodward notes that when Bannon instructed the future president on populism, his student was enthusiastic, if a bit hazy on the specifics: “That’s what I am, a popularist,” Trump responded.) Yet Bannon’s nationalist revolution was inseparable from his own exalted self-perception. “Bannon thought he was an action figure who had been stuck in a hermetically sealed package for decades until Trump finally freed him and brought him to life,” Sims writes. “I couldn’t help but appreciate anyone who had the stones to be that grandiose.”  ...Several contributors to the Chaos Chronicles offer one overriding concept to explain the president-- a single analytic lens through which his actions are explained and magnified. It is a reductionist exercise, often more clever than useful. But it is useful when it uncovers patterns in Trump’s behavior. Trump the mobster. Trump the tantrum-throwing toddler.  James Comey, the former FBI director and author of A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership, will forever be a central character of this time. He certainly deserves it. Comey was the first to inform Trump of the existence of the sketchy Russia dossier. (The president-elect responded by asking, rhetorically, if he seemed like the kind of guy who needs to hire prostitutes.) Comey’s sacking led to the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Russia’s election interference. And thanks to the lawman’s compulsion to write memos on his conversations with Trump, Comey’s private exchanges with the president are legend. (I’m surprised that I Need Loyalty is not the title of yet another Chaos Chronicle.) The new Showtime miniseries The Comey Rule, starring Jeff Daniels in the title role and based on Comey’s memoir, doesn’t hurt either.  ...While Comey echoes standard criticisms of Trump-- he is “unethical, untethered to truth and institutional values,” and his leadership is “transactional, ego driven, and about personal loyalty”-- his views are rooted not just in his own dealings with the president but in his memories of his years battling Mafia families as the U.S. attorney in Manhattan. “As I found myself thrust into the Trump orbit, I once again was having flashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against the Mob,” he explains. “The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things.” Ethical leaders, Comey argues, don’t need to yell, inspire fear, or issue threats. “Ethical leaders never ask for loyalty. Those leading through fear-- like a Cosa Nostra boss-- require personal loyalty.” Others closer to the president, such as his disgraced former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, succumbed to Trump’s demands for loyalty even while understanding the manipulation involved. Trump “talks like a mob boss,” Cohen writes in Disloyal, “using language carefully calibrated to convey his desires and demands, while at the same time employing deliberate indirection to insulate himself.” Cohen, who likens his teen years to those of the young Henry Hill character in the wise-guys classic Goodfellas, enjoyed no such insulation, which is why he wrote parts of his memoir from prison.  Daniel W. Drezner sees Trump not as a mobster but as a toddler, a comparison that is more amusing but also more alarming. Drezner, a professor of international politics at Tufts University, is best known in the Trump years as the keeper of a Twitter thread noting every time a Trump official or ally is cited in the press likening the president to a child. (As of this writing, he has passed 1,800 instances.)  It may be the funniest of the Chaos Chronicles, but The Toddler in Chief also outlines the risks of having a president with childlike traits, such as poor impulse control, defiant ignorance, a short attention span, temper tantrums, and a constant need for more screen time. Opportunistic advisers exploit his emotions to their advantage. He doubles down on mistakes just to avoid admitting them. He makes major decisions-- withdrawing forces from Syria, shutting down the government-- largely on impulse. Officials briefing him on key issues are hesitant to present findings that contradict Trump’s off-the-cuff positions. The result is a president “operating the executive branch like a bumper car, without any sense of peril,” Drezner writes. “The driver is not getting any better at his job. He is just getting more confident that there is no risk to what he is doing.”  That sense of peril may have been heightened in recent days, when not just the president and first lady but also multiple White House staffers, Republican senators, and even Trump’s campaign manager tested positive for COVID-19, just days after Trump mocked former Vice President Joe Biden in their debate for wearing his mask so often. But anyone anticipating that Trump’s public downplaying of the coronavirus will shift should remember that toddlers hate to admit they were ever wrong. The Toddler in Chief was completed before the outbreak went global, but Drezner still manages to anticipate something like it, even fleetingly. “Based on Trump’s behavior as cataloged in this book,” he writes, “the idea of Trump coping with a true crisis-- a terrorist attack, a global pandemic, a great power clash with China-- is truly frightening.”  Even more frightening? Such crises are not mutually exclusive.  For all the president’s blather about a nefarious deep state, his contempt for the deep-seated expertise of the federal government could prove most damaging. “If you want to preserve your personal immunity to the hard problems, it’s better never to really understand those problems,” Michael Lewis explains in The Fifth Risk, published in 2018.  That may be one of the most urgent books of the Trump years. Reading it in the middle of a presidency obsessed with alleged bureaucratic machinations feels subversive, almost countercultural; in the middle of a pandemic, the book feels downright prophetic. Lewis has written a love letter to America’s federal workforce, the researchers and the scientists and the data geeks too easily ignored until a crisis proves their value. “We don’t really celebrate the accomplishments of government employees,” Lewis writes. “They exist in our society to take the blame.” He wants to give them credit.  The Fifth Risk recounts the disastrous transition between the 2016 election and Trump’s inauguration. An outgoing administration is required by law to help the new crew prepare to run things, so Obama officials spent months readying detailed briefings for their successors, whomever they would be. Except Trump was not interested in such planning. “You and I are so smart that we can leave the victory party two hours early and do the transition ourselves,” he told former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who was originally tasked with the nominal transition effort.  Lewis took it upon himself to do what so many Trump officials didn’t: He interviewed former Obama officials from the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy and asked what they would have told their successors if they’d had the chance. What he found is a government that manages risks so large that no one person or company could ever handle them. The former chief risk officer at the Department of Energy ticks down the five problems that keep him up at night: a nuclear-weapons accident. North Korea. Iran. The vulnerability of the electrical grid. And fifth is faulty “project management,” what Lewis describes as the dangerous habit of patching up long-term problems with short-term solutions. Imagine The Big Short, but instead of Wall Street, it’s Washington.  Lewis lists some of the fast-moving, inevitable dangers that any president must consider, including pandemics, hurricanes, and terrorist attacks. (Yes, pandemics are first on his list.) But many risks are longer-term and therefore easily ignored. “It is delaying repairs to a tunnel filled with lethal waste until, one day, it collapses,” Lewis cautions. “It is the aging workforce of the DOE-- which is no longer attracting young people, as it once did-- that one day loses track of a nuclear bomb. It is the ceding of technical and scientific leadership to China. It is the innovation that never occurs, and the knowledge that is never created, because you have ceased to lay the groundwork for it. It is what you never learned that might have saved you.”  In Lewis’s telling, such risks are not just a matter of laziness or ineptitude, but deliberate neglect and avoidance. “There is an upside to ignorance, and a downside to knowledge,” Lewis writes, explaining Trump’s approach. “Knowledge makes life messier. It makes it a bit more difficult for a person who wishes to shrink the world to a worldview.”  As the Chaos Chronicles make clear, a global health and economic crisis such as the pandemic only magnifies Trump’s shortcomings. It demands that a leader rely on science and data, work across bureaucracies and agencies, communicate clearly and credibly with the public, and demonstrate basic empathy with Americans, who suffer regardless of their party, the color of their state, or the words on their hats. Instead, the president behaves as he always does, and believes what he wants to believe, whether on the origins and duration of the pandemic or the proper means to fight it. In Fear, an exasperated Gary Cohn asks the president about his beliefs on tariffs and trade. “Why do you have these views?” the economic adviser demands. Trump’s answer: “I just do. I’ve had these views for 30 years.” Similarly, Trump instinctively regarded the virus as a border-security problem, an immigration problem, a China problem, a messaging problem. He shrinks the world to a worldview.  “The office of the presidency depends on a measure of civic virtue,” Susan Hennessey and Benjamin Wittes argue in Unmaking the Presidency, published early this year. Traditionally, presidents are expected to promote shared values, serve as role models, and put service to the nation above service to self. They are expected to follow the law, or at least to speak and act as if they mean to. In Trump, the authors write, America instead has a leader whose life and presidency embody “an ongoing rejection of civic virtue.” Trump has made his presidency an extension of his campaign rallies, “a presidency that elevates the expressive and personal dimensions of the office over everything else.” It is the presidency as vanity plate, as zinger, as pinned tweet.  This notion of the “expressive presidency” is at the heart of Hennessey and Wittes’s book. In chapter after chapter, the authors contrast the norms that have grown around U.S. presidential behavior over the centuries-- involving ethics, honesty, organization, rhetoric, and deference to the rule of law-- with Trump’s gleeful violations of them. The president directs policy, hires and fires officials, and addresses the nation all with one eye on his own interests and the other on the passions of his core supporters. The result is a presidency “in which the institutional office and the personality of its occupant are almost entirely merged—merged in their interests, in their impulses, in their finances, and in their public character,” Hennessey and Wittes write. This reminds me of a moment in Disloyal, when Cohen is walking with Trump through the atrium of Trump Tower, and they’re suddenly mobbed by gawking tourists seeking photographs, autographs, and thrills. Trump winks at Cohen and whispers, “This is what Trump is all about.”  And it is what this presidency has been all about too. All the traditional functions of the office, its management roles, the execution of laws, and the “expectation of ethical conduct, truthfulness, and service,” as Hennessey and Wittes put it, have been downgraded, subsumed into spectacle surrounding the man. And Trump basically dares Congress, the courts, and the voters to do anything about it.  His musings about not respecting the outcome of the November election are another instance of the expressive presidency in action; he talks as though the legitimacy of the election is up to him, as if, in our system, it is his choice to make. “The ideas are mine,” Trump tells Woodward in Rage, when the reporter asks him how he decides on particular policies or positions. “Want to know something? Everything’s mine. You know, everything is mine.”  The irony is that governing in this way undercuts the effectiveness of the chief executive. Trump pays a price for announcing the withdrawal of forces from Syria so precipitously; for a travel ban that cannot pass muster in the courts; for simply tweeting out, without consultation, his decision that transgender Americans cannot serve in the armed forces. And the nation pays a dear price when Trump treats the pandemic as another opportunity for personal expression, misleading the public about the risks (“We have it totally under control”), the availability of testing (“Anybody that needs a test, gets a test”), the likely duration (“One day, it’s like a miracle-- it will disappear”), and its true impact (“It affects virtually nobody”). His decisions on when and how to reopen the economy seem guided more by electoral concerns than public-health considerations, and his outlandish televised briefings early in the crisis-- a mix of wish fulfillment, untruth, and score-settling-- seemed to embody the expressive presidency.  That is the point: Coherence and effectiveness don’t matter. Trump appears captivated by the theatrical, made-for-TV aspects of his job, such as press confrontations and campaign rallies. In Rage, when Woodward asks him for insight into his 2018 summit with Kim Jong Un, Trump cannot get past his obsession with the media throng. “You know, it was the most cameras... They had a thing set up for the media the likes of which you have never seen.” He constantly manufactures high-ratings moments, sometimes with disastrous consequences, as when police and National Guard members violently cleared anti-racism protesters out of Washington’s Lafayette Square just so Trump could stroll from the White House to St. John’s Episcopal Church and hold aloft a Bible for the cameras. In Trump’s vision, “the presidency is emphatically not about the successful management of bureaucracies or the implementation of policy objectives,” Hennessey and Wittes explain. “It is about the showmanship and flamboyance of the person and about entertaining and captivating audiences.”  What many of the Chaos Chronicles share is a preoccupation with the man at the middle of it all, an obsessive focus that probably appeals to this most self-centered of chief executives. No surprise that many books of the Trump era borrow his phrases for their title-- Fire and Fury, A Very Stable Genius, American Carnage, and more. (I’m waiting for a book on Trump’s rhetoric called The Best Words.) So much else is happening in this administration that gets lost in the Trump glare, material that is scattered throughout the Chaos Chronicles themselves.  One constant running through several of these books, for instance, is the astounding mix of arrogance and misjudgment displayed by Jared Kushner-- on immigration policy, Comey’s firing, the government shutdown, and much more. His misfires in the White House, including his inexplicable efforts to manage the response to the pandemic, merit book-length investigations. And Steve Bannon, too, could prove far less noteworthy for his nationalist huff-and-puff than for his calls to “deconstruct the administrative state,” as he liked to put it, just before the country, battling for its life and livelihood, would require the services of a competent and agile state more than ever. Woodward’s Fear and Rage both serve as indictments of the adults-in-the-room argument, the illusion that some of the experienced hands serving in the Trump administration-- whether Gary Cohn, Dan Coats, or James Mattis-- could settle him down. John Bolton’s The Room Where It Happened, written by one ostensible adult, reads like an exercise in score-settling, particularly aimed at Mattis. By coming off less as a national security adviser and more as a caustic observer of the lesser minds surrounding him, Bolton also undercuts the adults-in-the-room narrative. He was, at most, adulting in the room.  There is one more entry in the Chaos Chronicles, one that, despite its appendixes and footnotes, its legalese and double negatives, and its river of black-ink redactions, has become a unique cultural artifact of our time, spawning T-shirts and buttons and memes and podcasts and poetry and graphic-novel editions: Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report.  It has its own made-for-television moments. “This is the end of my presidency,” Trump moans when he learns of Mueller’s appointment. “I’m fucked.” There’s the contrast between the president’s public bluster, evident in his Twitter rants, and his private diffidence, embodied in Trump’s lawyerly written responses to Mueller’s queries, full of “I do not recall” and “I have no recollection.” There is the inevitable Nixonian reference, as when White House Counsel Don McGahn refuses the president’s request to instruct the deputy attorney general to dismiss Mueller, because McGahn worries about unleashing a new Saturday Night Massacre.  In its portrayal of the Trump campaign and White House, the Mueller report reminds me of several of the Chaos Chronicles. The incompetence, disorganization, and self-interest evoke Fire and Fury. The Mob-like mentality of the Trump team, with the president delegating dirty assignments to outside players, is reminiscent of Comey’s and Cohen’s accounts. And the Mueller report almost feels like a dozen anonymous New York Times op-eds from the internal White House resistance strung together, except far more detailed, and signed.  In Rage, Woodward rightly criticizes the report’s most memorable and controversial passage-- “While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,” Mueller & Co. wrote-- calling it “one of the most confusing lines in the history of high-profile investigations.” Yet even its formal and stilted writing can be effective. “An improper motive can render an actor’s conduct criminal even when the conduct would otherwise be lawful and within the actor’s authority,” the report explains, an understated but powerful refutation of the argument that the president can do whatever he wants and for whatever reason as long as he technically has the right to do it. The report recognizes Trump’s habit of committing wildly inappropriate acts-- such as discouraging the cooperation of witnesses-- right out in the open, a tendency that has perplexed journalists used to revealing misdeeds that lurk in the shadows. “That circumstance is unusual, but no principle of law excludes public acts from the reach of the obstruction laws,” the report explains. “If the likely effect of public acts is to influence witnesses or alter their testimony, the harm to the justice system’s integrity is the same.” It might even be worse, because the openness of the offense seems to excuse its occurrence. If it’s out in the open, how bad can it be?  Of course, the report’s authority and scope have limits. The report documents Russia’s “sweeping and systematic” interference in the 2016 election, for instance, but does not really reveal the impact of that interference. An omniscient narrator-- “the Office”-- is an essential player, but the special counsel’s own actions and impressions are largely absent. And though the report offers a devastating, point-by-point portrayal of the president’s efforts to interfere in the investigation against him, Mueller does stop short of declaring criminality. Not because, as the attorney general initially implied, he was simply unable to make up his mind. Part of his reasoning, Mueller explains in the report, was that “a federal criminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President’s capacity to govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct.” Constitutional processes. That’s a nice euphemism for the impeachment remedy. There are multiple ironies in the fate of the Mueller report. First is that, after so much investigation and expectation, after a damning 448-page trail of bread crumbs showing a path forward for Congress, the ultimate articles of impeachment against President Trump reflected none of the report’s findings or efforts. Second, as the Chaos Chronicles show, is that those “burdens on the President’s capacity to govern” have been overwhelmingly self-imposed. And third is that several recent entries in the Chaos Chronicles have come together in a backlash against the special counsel, one in which Mueller’s sense of honor, rectitude, and restraint are held against him.  In Trumpocalypse, the Atlantic writer David Frum criticizes the “upright and conservative Mueller” for always doing things by the book, even if “the book contained no chapter describing anything like a Trump presidency.” In A Very Stable Genius, Rucker and Leonnig conclude that Mueller “fumbled the moment,” in particular when his team inexplicably declined the opportunity to weigh in preemptively on Attorney General William Barr’s public characterization of the investigation’s findings. In True Crimes and Misdemeanors, Jeffrey Toobin writes that Mueller’s “code of personal honor … was both his greatest strength and his greatest weakness,” and that “to enforce the law, [Mueller] felt he had to comply with it-- in a manner consistent with his own fastidious values.”  When he was first appointed to the role, Mueller was hailed as a man of integrity, a dedicated lawman who would ferret out the truth. The expectations of him were enormous, especially from those who imagined that he would provide clear evidence of the president’s malfeasance. But when Mueller did not meet those expectations, his personal and professional qualities were suddenly deemed passé, relics of a “vanishing world,” Toobin writes. Mueller, he explains, “had come of age in a different era in American justice and American life, when modesty and self-effacement were ascendant values.”  There is no clearer or sadder affirmation of our new civic ethos. Narcissism and self-aggrandizement are now ascendant, integrity is old-fashioned, and chaos and crisis are the new standard-- not a hindrance to power but its purpose and protection.  That is what Trump is all about too.

Countries at the economic frontier are forward-looking, have robust economies, are open to investment and technology, and have competitive, well-matched workforces. In a previous blog, we explored the extent of this skills deficit.  The COVID-19 pandemic has made investing in the right skills more urgent. The lockdown has left thousands of workers unemployed and forced schools and universities to close, increasing the urgency of strategies for massive upskilling and retraining that is properly aligned with evolving labor market needs. A flexible workforce system that embraces technology and incentivizes employers’ participation will be more important than ever.  Why are adequate skills relevant to the economy?  Skills and knowledge, key components of human capital, are fundamental for long-term economic growth. They enable people to realize their potential as productive members of society, while it has become increasingly important to keep accumulating them throughout one’s life. Romania’s growth statistics over the last two decades show that the contribution of human capital to economic growth has been marginal compared to that of its physical capital stock and is declining. It decreased from an annual average of 4 percent between 1999 and 2008 to only 1 percent between 2009 and 2018. Meanwhile, the contribution of physical capital stock has remained near 40 percent. The recent Romania CEM2.0 Report found that improvements within individual firms have contributed little or negatively to aggregate productivity growth, suggesting that there is scope to improve firms’ capabilities, including managerial capabilities and employees’ skills. Skills deficits and accompanying skills mismatches, both of which are present in Romania, lead to potential loss of productivity, particularly when employers are forced to place lower-skilled workers in skilled positions, and have a negative impact on economic growth.  What are the underlying causes of Romania’s skills deficit?  Several factors contribute to Romania’s skills deficit, including institutional shortcomings in the education system, emigration patterns, and low participation in lifelong learning, particularly within firms, all of which have led to insufficient numbers of highly skilled workers (see Figure 1) to sustain the pace of growth.  Assessment of the Romanian education system suggests that current teaching approaches do not develop complex, higher-order skills (see the OECD 2017 Reviews of Evaluation and Assessment in Education). Romanian employers are critical of the relevance of the education system for several reasons. According to a 2017 World Bank Group survey, the curriculum for both secondary and tertiary education was reported to be overly theoretical, with a focus on abstract concepts rather than practical applications. Employers described teaching methods as outdated and highly traditional, with a focus on memorization rather than application. They also characterized the education system, at both pre-university and university levels, as highly resistant to change. Another shortcoming is underfinancing. At only 2.8 percent of GDP in 2017, Romania’s spending on education is the lowest in the European Union, with less than 2 percent of GDP for pre-tertiary education, which is less than half the EU-28 average.  Emigration of highly skilled workers aggravates the skills deficit. In the first decade of the 2000s, Romania recorded the largest increase of high-skilled immigration into the G-20 countries (reaching about 492,000 persons in 2010–11). The share of highly educated people amongst all emigrants was also high, at 23 percent as of 2010, the latest year for which data are available (World Bank 2018: Romania Systematic Country Diagnostic).  Adult participation in lifelong learning, at 1.1 percent in 2017, is the lowest in the EU, reflecting a disconnect between employers, workers, and education and training providers but also a limited provision of Continued Vocational Training (CVT). Most enterprises (73 percent) in Romania do not provide CVT, which is the traditional way by which employers respond to skills shortages. For firms providing training, accession is correlated to education level where employees with lower levels of education are less likely to participate in work-based training (Romania CEM2.0 Report).   Tackling the skills deficit  As the Fourth Industrial Revolution unfolds and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to accelerate automation and the digital economy, investing in the right workforce skills and training models is essential to keep pace with rapid changes in technology and markets.
