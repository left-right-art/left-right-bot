{"data": [{"text": "The National Collegiate Wrestling Association held its national championships this weekend, despite major concerns about the spread of COVID-19, a strain of the coronavirus.  The NCWA operates outside the NCAA, which suspended all sporting events in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Think of it as club wrestling, for teams outside of sanctioned NCAA competition.  The NCWA national championships saw over 600 athletes from 84 colleges in attendance, including large schools such as Ohio State and UCLA. The event was held in Allen, Texas, a suburb of Dallas.  When asked why the event wasn't canceled despite recommendations from local governments and the CDC, tournament executive director Jim Giunta told the Dallas Morning News that he believed \"a lot of this is driven by fear\" and \"we're going to operate on faith rather than fear.\"  The tournament had three main mats that were in use, according to the Dallas Morning News, which were sanitized just three times a day. Athletes who registered a fever over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit were meant to be disqualified, but officials said that no athletes had their temperatures taken at the event. Referees were not allowed to raise athletes' hands after winning a match.  While 11 schools dropped out due to coronavirus concerns, some coaches in attendance backed up Giunta's decision.  \"From a philosophical perspective, do I think it's overhyped? Yes, I do,\" said Liberty University coach Jesse Castro about the fear generated by the coronavirus. \"You know the talking points. We've dealt with this kind of stuff before. … We're vigilant and we use common sense, but I refuse to live in fear. I'm not gonna do that.\"  Castro, who brought 19 athletes to the event, said he believes part of the overreaction is related to ire directed at President Donald Trump. Castro said he concurred with his school president, Jerry Falwell Jr., who argued on Fox News earlier in the day that the coronavirus was being used by Democrats to impeach the president.

Unfortunately, the same doctors who were being applauded for their work, have taken to social media to narrate how they are being harassed and discriminated against in their housing complexes or rented accommodations. One government doctor, for example, was asked by his housing complex to stay away since he was treating patients who had tested positive for COVID-19.  Others have been forced to vacate their rented accommodation, leaving them stranded with nothing but their luggage. By any measure, this sort of treatment meted out to doctors is unacceptable.  So many incidents are coming to light of sincere govt doctors who are now being threatened to enter their own homes! Please look seriously into this matter@narendramodi sir.   Regards,  A govt doctor. pic.twitter.com/MmLHZejsjf — Dr.Devashish (@DevPalkar) March 23, 2020  A doctor serving at a government hospital treating patients suspected of COVID-19 in Delhi confirmed this in an interview with The Better India on the condition of anonymity.  “I live with my family at a rented accommodation in a pretty well-off locality in South Delhi. The day before yesterday, when I was on duty, some residents began harassing my parents. Even though I have taken all possible precautions at the hospital, they began telling my parents not to step out for groceries and to convey a message to me that I should not come back to the locality until this epidemic subsides,” he said.  After listening to his parents’ ordeal, the doctor called the local police. Fortunately, they stepped in and issued a warning against residents engaging in such behaviour. “Thankfully, nothing happened to my family and I, but I have heard even worse accounts from doctors in other cities. We don’t deserve this sort of treatment,” he adds.  Speaking to The New Indian Express on the condition of anonymity, one junior doctor at Hyderabad’s MGM Hospital said, “They recognise us with our lab coats and stethoscopes. Many doctors have been asked to vacate their rented homes by their landlords as they believe that doctors staying at their houses may make them more susceptible to Covid-19. One (house)-owner even said we were dirty. They asked us to vacate without any notice. Most of the doctors are now on the streets and have nowhere to go.”  Consequently, authorities at the Central and State level took cognisance of these acts and have promised to take necessary penal action against those engaging in such behaviour.  Responding to this widespread harassment, the Resident Doctor’s Association of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences wrote a letter to the Union Home Minister requesting “appropriate action against the eviction of Healthcare Professionals from their homes and provision of transport facility.”  Even the Federation of Resident Doctors Association in Kolkata wrote a similar letter to the union health ministry expressing their concerns.  “India has just one doctor for 1,445 Indians”  Those working in the public health care sector, especially doctors, were overworked even before the COVID-19 epidemic struck India.  With the epidemic spreading its tentacles further, the strain on them has grown even further. Replying to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Union Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey said in November 2019 that India has just one doctor for 1,445 Indians, which is much lower than the WHO’s prescribed norm of 1:1,000.  Moreover, these doctors, nurses and other medical staff are risking their lives every day in ensuring that the rest of us don’t fall prey to this epidemic. Let us not add to the pressure that they are already under. If the rest of us continue to exhibit such terrible behaviour, lest assured it will take a severe toll on their mental health as well.  The very least we can do is be thankful and not harass them.

On Sunday mornings I preach into the lens of a video camera, encouraging my online flock, coming to them live from a makeshift church studio. Virtually overnight, I had to reinvent myself as the Joel Osteen of Hingham, Massachusetts. Minus the private jet and the sickeningly sweet message that goes down like cotton candy but quickly dissolves into nothing.  None of this is by choice, of course. We’ve been streaming our church services on Facebook Live and through our website ever since we had to shut down in-person worship. On Easter, “Let us pray” was replaced with “Quiet on the set!”  Although we are worshipping virtually right now, there is nothing “virtual” about our faith. This world needs God’s love more than ever right now. And it needs us all to share God’s love with others.  That whole “love your neighbor as yourself” thing? This moment in our common life cries out for the embodiment of this command. Not with hugs or hand holding, but by praying for one another, by sharing our resources with those in need, by reaching out to those who are isolated and alone, by supporting those who are on the front lines of this pandemic, by making masks, by staying home, and even by watching your pastor morph into a televangelist.  I do mourn the loss of our communal interaction amid this time of social distancing. I miss gathering with friends, I miss seeing my beloved parishioners and worshipping with them in person, I miss sitting in the stands at baseball games, I miss writing at my favorite coffee shop. But all of these temporary measures are acts of love. They are ways of loving our neighbors as ourselves. And they serve as stark reminders that true love always involves sacrifice, which is what the story of Easter is all about  I will say that our online worship has been surprisingly interactive. One advantage is that people can share comments in real time. And so we can pray by name for someone’s uncle who has been hospitalized with COVID-19, or for a child’s grandmother who is living alone, or for the first responders and health care workers who have been risking their lives to serve others. For me, these interactive prayers serve as glimmers of glory in the midst of a rather painful time; reminders that God’s love may stand in stark relief to global anguish and isolation, but it doesn’t stand apart from it  I’ll probably never fully embrace the full-on televangelist vibe. Sure, like everyone else, my hair’s getting longer, but I can’t imagine it’ll turn into a Jimmy Swaggart-worthy bouffant. I haven’t started referring to St. John’s as my own personal Crystal Cathedral. My suits aren’t shiny, I don’t have a 900 number, and I exercised great restraint in not inviting people to touch the screen and be healed during the Easter service.  But until we gather together again as a congregation, I will continue to embrace technologies that keep us connected. And I’m reminded again and again that the church is not a building, but its people.  The Rev. Tim Schenck is an Episcopal priest at St. John’s Church in Hingham, MA.

Ventilators are a vital tool for medical facilities treating patients with COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus.  He also told reporters they should look into a purported disappearance of masks from New York hospitals.  Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.  President Donald Trump has accused hospitals of hoarding ventilators and says the devices need to be released.  Trump made the remarks during a White House press briefing on Sunday night.  \"We have some healthcare workers, some hospitals ... hoarding equipment including ventilators,\" he said. \"We have to release those ventilators — especially hospitals that are never going to use them.\"  Trump did not specify which hospitals were hoarding ventilators, nor did he provide evidence to back up his claims.  He also told reporters they should look into a purported disappearance of masks from New York hospitals, where he said use had risen from 20,000 a week to up to 300,000.  \"Where are the masks going — are they going out the backdoor?\" Trump asked rhetorically.  New York has become the epicenter of the US coronavirus outbreak. As of Sunday night, the state had confirmed more than 59,600 coronavirus cases and more than 965 deaths.  Ventilators are a vital tool for medical facilities trying to save the lives of people with COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. But experts have warned that America faces a shortage of critical supplies in the months ahead as the number of cases continues to grow.  A February report from the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins found that the US had about 170,000 ventilators, including about 8,900 held in a national reserve.  One expert has estimated about 1 million Americans may need ventilator treatment during the coronavirus outbreak, straining the country's resources even if all those cases do not overlap. Shortages of other medical gear like masks have already started to affect US hospitals.  On Wednesday, Trump issued an executive order meant to prevent the hoarding and price gouging of essential medical equipment, including ventilators, masks, and chloroquine, a drug in clinical trials to test its viability as a coronavirus treatment.  Gov. Andrew Cuomo said last week that New York needed 30,000 more ventilators to address the expected influx of coronavirus patients.  But Trump has disputed such estimates. Trump told the Fox News host Sean Hannity last week that he didn't think areas needed 30,000 to 40,000 more ventilators to treat patients.  \"I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators,\" Trump told Hannity. \"You go into major hospitals sometimes, and they'll have two ventilators. And now, all of a sudden, they're saying, 'Can we order 30,000 ventilators?'\"  Trump invoked the Defense Production Act — a Korean War-era national security legislation that lets the president direct industries to manufacture essentials during a national crisis — on Friday, compelling General Motors to help the country produce ventilators.  Trump had earlier attacked GM on Twitter after The New York Times reported that the US government was having second thoughts about a deal with the company to produce ventilators.  \"As usual with 'this' General Motors, things just never seem to work out,\" he tweeted. \"They said they were going to give us 40,000 much-needed Ventilators, 'very quickly'. Now they are saying it will only be 6,000, in late April, and they want top dollar.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 10, "positive": 23, "negative": 2, "joy": 3, "anger": 5, "surprise": 11, "fear": 4}, "metadata": ["donald", "trump", "treating", "respiratory", "masks", "briefing", "healthcare", "epicenter", "coronavirus", "america", "johns", "hopkins", "americans", "andrew", "sean", "crisis"]}, {"text": "Copyright 2020 NPR.

He is chancellor of the New York City schools - joins us from home. Good morning, sir.  RICHARD CARRANZA: Good morning. Thank you for having me.  INSKEEP: You have officially said New York schools are closed until what date?  CARRANZA: The initial date is April 20. But we're being driven by the circumstances and the advice of our health commissioner and the state of New York. And as things are exploding across the state right now, it's looking more and more likely that we will finish the school year with learning at home.  INSKEEP: Well, let's talk about learning at home, particularly because of the kind of student body you have - huge, first off - more than a million students, if I'm not mistaken - and also of all kinds of incomes, including a lot of poor kids and immigrants. What are the challenges of learning at home?  CARRANZA: Well, for us, almost 80% of our students qualify for free and reduced lunch, so it's a poor student population, 1.1 million students. Obviously, the digital divide, which is students that have technology at home and those that don't, is a huge challenge. We estimate that of the 1.1 million students, about 300,000 students don't have the devices to learn remotely at home.  But the good news is - never waste a crisis - we're going to eliminate the digital divide. We've purchased 300,000 devices. We started delivering the first batch of those, 25,000 devices, to homeless shelters for our students that are homeless yesterday. We are going to continue on a rolling basis to deliver those devices over the next coming weeks. So within a month, we are going to eliminate the digital divide for the students in New York City - and then just giving advice to parents and students around, how do you do learning at home?  INSKEEP: I'm just feeling the dismay when we're telling people to stay home that you're talking about kids in homeless shelters. Is it inevitable that some kids are just going to drop out of sight in this process?  CARRANZA: Well, the good thing is that we have incredibly dedicated teachers and administrators in New York City. And we have a whole protocol worked out of how we're going to - I wouldn't call it take attendance, but we're going to check in with students to make sure we know where everyone is. The people that know their students the best are their teachers, so the teachers are absolutely on call to make sure that they know where their students are. They can check in with them on a daily basis.  And anybody that's not checking in, we're going to send people to find them and find out, where are you? Are you OK? What do you need? So again, we're building this plane as we're flying it, but we are very committed to making sure that we know where our students are and that they're being served.  INSKEEP: Is the poverty of the student body part of the reason that you, even though you're in this devastated area, waited several days longer than many other school districts around the country to announce you were closing?  CARRANZA: Well, again, that's a call that the mayor makes because he has to take into account what's happening not only with the school system, but the entire city, a city of almost 9 million people. But if you shut down the schools, then these are children of first responders, of health care workers, of sanitation workers. So it has a significant impact on the city if those people don't have somewhere for their children to be. So it was a very weighty decision.  And again, we followed the advice of the health care professionals, our commissioner of the Department of Health, the commissioner of health in New York state. And when the mayor made the decision to close the schools, it was after healthy consultation and a very, very serious look at how would we then serve the students of those first responders.  INSKEEP: As I'm sure you know, Chancellor, some school employees went to the New York Post and said that you'd waited too long, accused you of even making some efforts to hide some of the information as teachers grew sick. Do you regret any of your decisions and the mayor's decisions in those crucial days?  CARRANZA: No. No. 1, it's the Post? Really? But No. 2, you know, people that make those claims don't have the responsibility or the weight of responsibility of making these kinds of decisions. So again, we followed the advice of the health care professionals, the people, the epidemiologists that do this for a living. And again, when we made the decision to close the schools, when the mayor said, we're going to close the schools, we were ready to launch into remote learning and provide students with the ability to keep learning for however long we go.  INSKEEP: Chancellor, can you tell us something about Dez-Ann Romain, a New York City school principal who we're told is the first school employee in New York to have died from the coronavirus?  CARRANZA: She was absolutely a force to be reckoned with. She worked in one of our high schools for students that had left the system and come back to the system. She took no prisoners. And she made sure that her students had everything they needed to be successful, not only to get their high school diploma, but then to have options post-high school diploma - a tremendous loss to our community. And our heart just breaks for her. We're really feeling her loss.  INSKEEP: Chancellor, thanks for the time, really appreciate it.   CARRANZA: Thank you.  INSKEEP: Richard Carranza is chancellor of the New York City schools. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

Kamala Harris is raising money for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden while speaking out about the disproportionate number of African Americans with COVID-19.  Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar has been praising the former vice-president on television and Twitter as she unveils a plan to fight the coronavirus in rural America.  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer went on “The Daily Show” to plead for help addressing the pandemic while wearing a T-shirt with a jab at President Donald Trump.  As Biden begins the process of choosing a running mate, responding to the COVID-19 pandemic has become an unexpected part of the audition. The women believed to be top candidates are competing for the job by trying to show off their leadership on issues thrust into the spotlight by the virus.  That’s easier for some than for others. The coronavirus has put politics on the back burner for many. Rallies and fundraisers — where potential vice-presidential candidates might essentially audition for the position — are barely happening. Meanwhile, governors in the running might seem to have an advantage as their official day job becomes a public test of their ability to handle a crisis in the spotlight.  “Everything has changed, and this time calls for a No. 2 who can project confidence to voters that they can manage a pandemic,” said Adrienne Elrod, a Democratic strategist who was a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. “If you can show that you’re doing that effectively, that makes you a more attractive choice, obviously.”  There is only so much a potential running mate can do to influence a decision that ultimately comes down to who the candidate believes is the right choice. Biden has said he’ll pick a woman. He may consider whether a senator hails from a state with a Democratic governor to ensure her replacement in the Senate would be from the same party.  But he also has stressed he’s looking for someone who’s “ready to be president on a moment’s notice.”  Besides Harris, Klobuchar and Whitmer, other women who’ve been part of the speculation are Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Georgia governor candidate Stacey Abrams, Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.  Almost all have said they are “flattered” or “honoured” to be mentioned as likely short-listers but are focused on the pandemic. Warren said on MSNBC she would accept the VP job if Biden offered it to her. Abrams, the former minority leader of the Georgia House of Representatives, told Elle magazine she would be “an excellent running mate,” noting she has a record of executive management and, as an African American woman, could motivate “typically ignored communities.“  Harris has launched a campaign of sorts to shine light on the disproportionate effect the coronavirus has had on black Americans. In recent weeks, she’s talked with prominent black radio hosts and commentators Steve Harvey, Roland Martin, Zerlina Maxwell and Joe Madison and participated in a coronavirus town hall hosted by Sean “Diddy” Combs on the rapper-producer’s Revolt TV.  A Harris adviser said the senator, the lone Democratic black woman in the Senate, is using her platform to highlight the racial disparities of the pandemic. The media blitz comes after a presidential campaign in which she had trouble connecting with many black voters, especially some of the young black progressives skeptical of Biden. As many Democrats pressure Biden to select a black woman as his running mate, it would make sense for Harris to shore up any potential weaknesses there.  Klobuchar has been trying to show the Biden campaign that she’s a good teammate since she dropped her presidential bid and endorsed him ahead of the March 3 Super Tuesday contests, just in time to help him win her home state of Minnesota. She campaigned for him in states including Michigan and has been promoting him on television and social media while pushing issues such as vote by mail, which she says would allow people to safely vote in November.  On Thursday, Klobuchar released a plan to prepare for and respond to the coronavirus in rural areas, where COVID-19 has been slower to spread but where there are more older people and health care systems are less equipped to handle a surge in cases. Klobuchar has touted her record of winning in rural, typically more conservative areas and still sees her knowledge of rural issues as a point in her favour as a vice-presidential pick.  Biden’s team sees Whitmer, one of his campaign co-chairs in a top battleground state, as consciously trying to be viewed as a serious contender. First, that means doing her job well in Michigan but also leveraging her role in national media. She’s already shown an ability to handle criticism from Trump, whose leadership during the pandemic she has criticized. After Trump referred to Whitmer as “that woman from Michigan,” she appeared on “The Daily Show” wearing a T-shirt with the four-word description on it.  Warren notably didn’t endorse Biden until Wednesday, more than a month after she dropped her presidential bid. But when asked Wednesday on MSNBC whether she would serve as Biden’s vice-president if asked, she said yes.  Warren has noted she released a plan to help fight pandemics on Jan. 28, well before Biden or any other presidential candidate. She also founded an activist group she’s dubbed Warren Democrats. She’s attempting to tap her sizable national collection of mostly small, online donors with an eye to boosting her Senate reelection campaign in 2024 — especially after she finished third in her home state during the presidential race — but also to elect Democrats “who share our vision.“   ___  Loading...

Overall the population has suffered a significant decline in wellbeing, with high levels of stress and anxiety, according to draft research findings into the psychological impact of the measures.  Being outdoors, whether walking or gardening, had the most calming effect for people, the research conducted by a sub-group of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) indicated.  In contrast, home-schooling of children was the highest reported stressor for parents who responded to a survey of more than 600 people.  “While not completely surprising, the frequency with which home-schooling of children popped up as a source of stress points to the need for more support for parents in this endeavour,” said Liam Delaney, professor of economics at UCD, one of the members of the sub-group.  He said the consumption of social media regarding the epidemic was also a major source of anxiety among people.  The day reconstruction study was conducted on March 23rd and March 24th, after schools and colleges were closed but before the 2km limit of outside movement and cocooning of over-70s was introduced.   Key messages  Separate research commissioned by the behavioural change sub-group of NPHET found a high awareness of the key messages around hand-washing and social distances, but lower awareness of cough and sneeze etiquette rules.  One-quarter of people struggled to recall what they needed to do if they had coronavirus symptoms, and what to do if they came into contact with someone with symptoms.  The research suggested emotional and efficacy messages have a greater impact on behaviour than material stressing awareness of the rules.  People under 40, and men, seemed to be slightly less aware despite feeling they are more likely to contract the virus.  Prof Delaney said the high level of adherence to the restrictions showed no sign of dropping at the time the research was carried out.  The full study is due to be published shortly.

While Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was quick to caution that the U.S. still has much work to do amid this public health emergency, he pointed to \"good signs\" from New York, citing data saying the numbers of hospitalizations, ICU admissions and requirements for intubations over the last three days have started to level off.  \"Everybody who knows me know I'm very conservative about making projections, but those are the kind of good signs that you look for,\" Fauci said during Monday's coronavirus task force briefing at the White House. \"You never even begin to think about claiming victory prematurely, but that's the first thing you see when you start to see the turnaround.\"  US coronavirus map: Tracking the outbreak  CLOSE Social distancing matters. Here is how to do it and how it can help curb the COVID-19 pandemic. USA TODAY  Fauci stressed the importance of continued mitigation and social distancing.  \"That tells me — instead of saying, 'Hmm, that's pretty good' — it's we got there through mitigation. We cut off the stream of people who, ultimately, required hospitalization, required intubation, required all of the kinds of extreme methods,\" he said.  \"So, we've just got to realize that this is an indication, despite all the suffering, and the death that has occurred, that what we have been doing has been working. So, the call that I say every time I get to this podium is just keep it up. Because this is gonna get us out of it. This is our best and only great public health tool.\"  Dr. Deborah Birx said she and others are starting to see the impact of the social distancing measures being enacted nationwide, \"But we have to do even more right now because that will predict where we are two or three weeks from now.\"  There were nearly 11,000 deaths and more than 368,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S. late Monday night, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.  Birx said she and Fauci believe \"if we work as hard as we can over the next several weeks that we will see potential to go under the numbers that were predicted by the models.\"  Stop the spread of coronavirus: Here's how to make your own face mask  Fauci said he believes the country can get under the 100,000 to 200,000 deaths predicted by models as recently as last week, with Birx crediting \"the extraordinary compliance of the American people.\"  A group of leaders in states hit hard by the spread of coronavirus said Monday they were seeing positive signs. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said deaths and hospitalizations showed signs of \"plateauing,\" though he added hospitals are still at maximum capacity.  CLOSE President Donald Trump jumped in when a reporter asked Dr. Anthony Fauci about the controversial use of hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus.

Jay Inslee said his state will return more than 400 ventilators received from the Strategic National Stockpile. In Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards said the state may have reached its peak of coronavirus infections.  \"I don't think anyone has every mitigated the way I've seen people mitigate right now,\" Fauci said. \"This has never happened in this country before. So, I am optimistic — always cautiously optimistic — that if we do what I've been talking about over the past few minutes, we can make that number go down.  \"I don't accept, every day, that we're going to have to have 100,000 to 200,000 deaths.

Health care workers snap gloves on as the first line of protection against catching COVID-19 from patients, and they’re crucial to protecting patients as well. But medical-grade glove supplies are running low globally, even as more feverish, sweating and coughing patients arrive in hospitals by the day.  Malaysia is by far the world’s largest medical glove supplier, producing as many as three out of four gloves on market. The industry has a history of mistreating migrant workers who toil over hand-sized molds as they’re dipped in melted latex or rubber, hot and exhausting work.  The Malaysian government ordered factories to halt all manufacturing starting March 18. Then, one by one, those that make products deemed essential, including medical gloves, have been required to seek exemptions to reopen, but only with half of their workforce to reduce the risk of transmitting the new virus, according to industry reports and insider sources. The government says companies must meet domestic demand before exporting anything. The Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association this week is asking for an exception.  “Any halt to the production and administrative segments of our industry would mean an absolute stoppage to glove manufacturing and it will be disastrous to the world,” said association president Denis Low in a statement released to Malaysian media. He said their members have received requests for millions of gloves from about 190 countries.  U.S. imports of medical gloves were already 10 percent lower last month than during the same period last year, according to trade data complied by Panjiva and ImportGenius. Experts say greater declines are expected in coming weeks. Other countries making gloves including Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Turkey and especially China are also seeing their manufacturing disrupted due to the virus.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced Tuesday it was lifting a block on imports from one leading Malaysian medical glove manufacturer, WRP Asia Pacific, where workers had allegedly been forced to pay recruitment fees as high as $5,000 in their home countries, including Bangladesh and Nepal.  The CBP said they lifted the September order after learning the company is no longer producing the medical gloves under forced labor conditions.  “We are very pleased that this effort successfully mitigated a significant supply chain risk and resulted in better working conditions and more compliant trade,” said CBP’s Executive Assistant Commissioner for the Office of Trade Brenda Smith.  The Southeast Asian medical glove manufacturing industry is notorious for labor abuses, including demanding recruitment fees that send impoverished workers into crushing debt.  “Most of the workers who are producing the gloves that are essential in the global COVID-19 endemic are still at high risk of forced labor, often in debt bondage,” said Andy Hall, a migrant workers rights specialist who has been focusing on conditions in Malaysian and Thai rubber glove factories since 2014.  In 2018, workers told several news organizations they were trapped in factories and grossly underpaid while working overtime. In response, importers, including Britain’s National Health Service, demanded change, and companies promised to end recruitment fees and provide good working conditions.  Since then, advocates like Hall say there have been improvements, including recent food handouts at some factories. But workers still suffer long, arduous shifts, and receive little pay to make medical gloves for the world. Most of the workers in the Malaysian factories are migrants, and live in crowded hostels at the factories where they work. Like everyone in Malaysia, they’re now locked down because of the virus.  “These workers, some of the invisible heroes of modern times in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, deserve much more respect for the essential work they do,” said Hall.  Gloves are just one of many types of medical equipment now in short supply in the U.S.  The AP reported last week that imports of critical medical supplies including N95 masks have sharply declined in recent weeks due to factory closures in China, where manufacturers had been required to sell all or part of their supply internally rather than export to other countries.  Rachel Gumpert, director of communications and membership services for the Oregon Nurse’s Association said hospitals in the state are “on the edge of crisis.”  “Across the board there’s not enough of anything,” she said. They’re mostly lacking adequate masks right now, she said, but “in two weeks we’ll be in a very bad place in terms of gloves.”  Send questions/comments to the editors.   « Previous   Next »  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 25, "positive": 33, "negative": 7, "disgust": 1, "joy": 2, "anger": 8, "fear": 5, "trust": 8}, "metadata": ["catching", "workforce", "china", "global", "debt", "n95", "masks", "closures"]}, {"text": "{\"main\": [ { \"isExtLogin\": false, \"id\": \"303199998\", \"guid\": \"A7612E16-E0AA-4C1B-86E0-D77446582617\", \"type\": \"story\", \"origin\":\"local\", \"contentLevel\":\"\", \"subView\": false, \"title\": \"Louisiana governor warns of virus trajectory like Italy\", \"titleLength\": 57, \"summary\": \"\", \"byline\": [{ \"name\": \", The Associated Press\" }] , \"pubDateWeekday\": \"Thursday\", \"pubDate\": \"Mar 19, 2020 at 10:04 AM\", \"pubDateFormat\": { \"yyyy-mm-dd\": \"2020-03-19\", \"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss\": \"2020-03-19 10:04:58\", \"yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss\": \"2020-03-19T15:04:58+0000\", \"timeZone:yyyymmddThh:mm:ssZ\": \"20200319T16:04:58Z\", \"yyyymmddThh:mm:ssZ\": \"20200319T10:04:58Z\" }, \"modDateFormat\": { \"yyyy-mm-dd\": \"2020-03-19\", \"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss\": \"2020-03-19 18:33:00\", \"timeZone:yyyymmddThh:mm:ssZ\": \"20200320T00:33:00Z\", \"yyyymmddThh:mm:ssZ\": \"20200319T18:33:00Z\" }, \"modDate\": \"Mar 19, 2020 at 6:33 PM\", \"isoPubDate\": \"20200319100458\", \"isoModDate\": \"20200319183350\", \"link\": \"https://www.houmatoday.com/news/20200319/louisiana-governor-warns-of-virus-trajectory-like-italy\", \"shareLink\": \"http://houmatoday.com/news/20200319/louisiana-governor-warns-of-virus-trajectory-like-italy\", \"urlencodedLink\": \"http%3A%2F%2Fhoumatoday.com%2Fnews%2F20200319%2Flouisiana-governor-warns-of-virus-trajectory-like-italy\", \"canonicalLink\":\"https://www.houmatoday.com/news/20200319/louisiana-governor-warns-of-virus-trajectory-like-italy\", \"localLink\":\"https://www.houmatoday.com/news/20200319/louisiana-governor-warns-of-virus-trajectory-like-italy\", \"staticLink\":\"https://www.houmatoday.com/article/20200319/NEWS/303199998\", \"thumbnail\":{ \"link\":\"https://www.houmatoday.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=DA&Date=20200319&Category=NEWS&ArtNo=303199998&Ref=AR\" }, \"track\": { \"articlePath\": \"/article/20200319/NEWS/303199998\", \"authorPath\": \"/author: /Louisiana governor warns of virus trajectory like Italy/20200319/303199998\" }, \"metered\": false, \"priority\": \"\", \"category\": \"News\", \"taxonomies\": [\"Louisiana\"], \"gh_keywords\": [], \"keywords\": [\"Louisiana\"], \"banner\": \"\", \"bannerLink\": \"\", \"viafouraUniqueID\":\"art-A7612E16-E0AA-4C1B-86E0-D77446582617-pub3824\", \"newsletterForm\": true, \"moreNewslettersLink\": \"http://myprofile.houmatoday.com/\", \"googleIndexDisable\":false, \"body\": [ \"  BATON ROUGE (AP) \\\" Gov. John Bel Edwards said Thursday that a growing number of new coronavirus cases could push Louisiana past its capacity to deliver health care in as few as seven days, comparing the state's possible situation to that of Italy, where the virus has overwhelmed hospitals.  Edwards asked President Donald Trump for federal help on Trump's national conference call with governors, telling the president Louisiana's system could be strained beyond capacity in a week.  At a later news conference he said that timeline was a 'worst-case scenario\\\" that Louisiana could realize unless people stay safe distances from others and follow his statewide restrictions, which banned gatherings over 50 people, shuttered bars and gyms and limited restaurants to delivery and takeout.  'I am imploring every resident of the state of Louisiana, 'You have a role to play,'' the Democratic governor said. He added: 'If we are not going to look like Italy in 10 days or two weeks, it will only be because of these mitigation measures.'  The number of known virus infections in Louisiana jumped to 392, according to health department figures, up from 280 a day earlier. Louisiana has one of the nation's highest per capita rates of infection, Edwards said, with New Orleans at the epicenter of the state's outbreak.  Meanwhile, the state's death toll rose to 10 Thursday with the latest victims, a 44-year-old New Orleans resident with underlying health conditions and a 91-year-old resident of Lambeth House, the New Orleans retirement home where a cluster of cases prompted four other deaths, the governor said.  'My fear, based on modeling that I've received today, is that in as little as seven days we could start to exceed our capacity to deliver health care,' Edwards told Trump.  He said the state sought federal approval to 'surge patients' at the VA hospital in New Orleans.  \\\"I'm going to try to get you immediate approval on the hospital,' Trump told Edwards, in a telephone conference the president held with governors that was carried by news networks.  Tulane Health System in New Orleans said it planned to shut down a suburban emergency room Friday to move staff to its downtown New Orleans campus to deal with 'a surge of COVID-19 and suspected COVID-19 patients.' Other hospitals were canceling elective procedures to help free up space.  In addition to strained bed capacity, Edwards said health care facilities in Louisiana, like counterparts around the nation, were having difficulty getting medical equipment, particularly ventilators.  Though most of the cases are in the New Orleans region, the virus has shown up in 26 of Louisiana's 64 parishes.  The vast majority of people recover within weeks after catching the virus, and for most people, it causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause severe illness requiring hospitalization.  Amid tightened restrictions on businesses, unemployment and food stamp applications have spiked in Louisiana amid the wider economic impact of the outbreak. More than 30,000 new claims for unemployment assistance had been filed by midday Thursday, up from 1,700 for all of last week, the state's labor secretary Ava Dejoie said. The online application system was overloaded, and Dejoie urged people to keep trying in non-peak hours, like during early morning hours.  Small businesses will be eligible to apply for low-interest federal disaster loans after the U.S. Small Business Administration approved a state request to make aid available statewide.  Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon issued new regulations requiring health insurers to waive co-pays and deductibles for COVID-19 testing, and banning insurers from requiring prior authorization for testing ordered by doctors. Insurers also must allow early refills of most non-opioid medications.  Also, Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, of Jefferson Parish, announced he now must work remotely on the national coronavirus response because he had an 'extended meeting' last week with Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart of Florida, who tested positive. Scalise said he does not have any COVID-19 symptoms, but is self-isolating out of caution.   ___  McGill reported from New Orleans.   ___  The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Greene County currently has five confirmed cases of COVID-19 and is responding with measures to proactively reduce further exposure as it impacts limited resources.  County Legislature Chairman Patrick Linger said, “While you may be seeking refuge from the larger amount of cases downstate, you must be aware that this is a global pandemic. You and your family have a critical role to fulfill in halting the rapid spread of this potentially deadly virus, which can be dangerous and even fatal to the elderly and people with underlying health conditions.”  The novel coronavirus pandemic has impacted New York State, which is responding with all resources to contain a growing number of cases, which includes more than 15,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and multiple deaths.  Of Greene County’s confirmed cases, none originated from within the county.  The county advisory noted that the number of exposures will increase with movement into the area from other parts of the state and country, requiring a large amount of resources by public health, first responders, health care providers, and other government personnel to contain and limit further transmission.  Linger encouraged people to avoid entering Greene County. “Greene County is a large rural county with no hospital! There is no hospital in Greene County. This limits our ability to serve a large number of people requiring higher levels of care for COVID-19 patients and other illnesses. These facts mean any additional needs presented at our surrounding hospitals will tax our medical care system beyond its capacity. While the County’s emergency services and responders are currently operating at full capacity, it’s important we also don’t stretch their capacity.”  Linger stressed his message that “Travel into Greene County from any area at this time is inadvisable and is highly discouraged.”  For comprehensive information, coronavirus.health.ny.gov.

Flanked by government officials, he accurately told the nation that the risk to Americans remains low, that the country should prepare out of an abundance of caution and that a vaccine was in the works.  Here's what the president said and what the facts are.  Claim: The risk to Americans is low  \"The risk to the American people remains very low,\" Trump said during the news conference.  Later, pressed on whether he agreed with health officials' view that coronavirus will inevitably spread in the U.S., he said: \"I don't think it's inevitable. It probably will. It possibly will. It could be at a very small level, or it could be at a larger level. Whatever happens, we're totally prepared.\"  This broadly tracks with what top public health officials have said, although some have warned about the impending spread in stronger terms.  \"It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a media briefing Tuesday.  Claim: A vaccine is coming in a 'fairly quick manner'  \"We're rapidly developing a vaccine,\" Trump said. \"The vaccine is coming along well, and in speaking to the doctors we think this is something that we can develop fairly rapidly.\"  Later, he added: \"But that's a little bit like the flu. It's a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And we'll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.\"  This is a bit exaggerated. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in the same news conference that a potential vaccine is in rapid development but that a final product is at least a year to 18 months away — if trials that are happening now succeed. This is fast for a vaccine, but it's not going to help anyone imminently.  Claim: Trump says there are just 15 coronavirus cases in the U.S.  The president repeatedly pointed to the 15 cases of coronavirus in the U.S.  There are actually 60 in total, but the CDC categorizes them in two groups. Fifteen were diagnosed in the U.S. — Trump said he calls them \"the original 15\" — and 45 cases involve people who were repatriated with the virus from abroad.  Claim: The flu kills more people  \"I want you to understand something that shocked me when I saw it, that I spoke with Dr. Fauci on this, and I was really amazed, and I think most people were amazed to hear it. The flu in our country kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year. That was shocking to me,\" Trump said before comparing it to those sickened by the coronavirus. \"And so far, if you look at what we have with the 15 people, and they're recovering, one is pretty sick but hopefully will recover. But the others are in great shape.\"  Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak  So far, it's true that the flu kills a lot more people. Coronavirus is a respiratory virus like flu, and the symptoms are similar, like fever, cough and fatigue. But comparing flu and coronavirus is difficult, because flu has a predictable season and there are still so many unknowns about coronavirus.  \"We don't know this virus,\" Dr. Bruce Alyward, leader of the World Health Organization's joint mission with China on COVID-19, said at a news briefing Tuesday. \"We don't know what's going to happen next.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 19, "positive": 19, "negative": 4, "disgust": 6, "joy": 1, "anger": 3, "surprise": 7, "fear": 10, "trust": 3}, "metadata": ["coronavirus", "donald", "trump", "americans", "caution", "vaccine", "respiratory", "diseases", "media", "briefing", "institute", "infectious", "repeatedly", "cdc", "diagnosed", "virus", "fauci", "outbreak", "symptoms", "cough", "china"]}, {"text": "State emergency management officials are negotiating with hotels as places to quarantine people who aren’t sick enough with COVID-19 to require treatment in intensive care units, but who might serve as viral transmission vectors if sent home to their families.  Convention centers might also be enlisted into the plan, which could include sheltering asymptomatic people who’ve tested positive for the new coronavirus.  “We’re absolutely considering that,” the governor said during a a news conference Saturday at the state’s Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee.  “The reason why you would want to do that is, if somebody comes in, tests positive, if you send them back home they’re likely to infect the people they come into contact with in their home. Then the virus continues to spread,” he continued.  “If they have a place to self-isolate, where they’re not going to be in close contact with anybody, then the virus dies with them,” he said. It might be a way to make sure “the core hospital is not overwhelmed.”  Thirty-four hospitals in Florida are at 50 percent capacity, and state health officials have identified six that are entirely vacant and might be drafted into service, DeSantis said.  Much of the state’s effort has been aimed at protecting older people who are most susceptible to fatal complications. That doesn’t mean younger people can’t be infected and undergo serious symptoms — in fact, the governor said, 60 percent of Florida’s infected are under age 60.  The Florida Phoenix reports caseload updates from the Department of Health under The Phoenix Flyer tab on our homepage.  DeSantis warned against giving credence to some of the more far-out theories about COVID-19 that are circulating on social media.  “There’s no need to panic about this. You just need to take the proper precautions and take the proper steps to protect yourself. At the end of the day, if you follow the basic rules that the CDC has recommended, such as maintaining good hygiene, washing your hands religiously, and maintaining proper social distance from people, you are going to be OK.”  Although most cases in Florida thus far involve patients who contracted the virus through travel to hot spots, the state still lacks sufficient test kits to understand the full extent of the pandemic — although officials are monitoring data on symptoms associated with COVID-19, including elevated body temperatures, state Surgeon General Scott Rivkees said.  Still, DeSantis has to a large extent allowed local officials to lead in terms of closing beaches and other social gathering places, shying away from ordering the sort of shelter-in-place orders issued by officials in California and New York — as Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services Nikki Fried has urged.  He did order bars, restaurants, movie theaters, and many other businesses closed on Friday.  The governor argued Saturday that conditions in Florida are different from New York and California. Densely populated New York City, in particular, “is kind of the perfect place where something like this would spread.”  Moreover, some of the more alarming projections of coronavirus transmission “are built on assumptions and models” that he doesn’t necessarily find convincing.  In addition, DeSantis has warned of the dangers of social distancing fatigue.  In fact, he praised The Villages residents for observing social distancing guidelines while continuing to play golf — one to each golf cart and no handling the pin.  DeSantis even hopes to open a drive-through test site Monday at The Villages — the plan is to let the senior citizens who live there drive through in the golf carts many use to get around.  “This is something that affects the social fabric. I know a lot of people have been uneasy, have been very anxious. You’re in a situation where a lot of the things you used to do are no longer available. You turn on the TV, there’s no sports to watch, there’s not a lot of live events,” he said.  Instead, there’s 24-hour news coverage of the coronavirus, he continued.  “I would just urge people to take a deep breath, understand that you can protect yourself against this.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 5, "positive": 25, "negative": 6, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 2, "joy": 2, "anger": 2, "fear": 7, "trust": 3}, "metadata": ["quarantine", "viral", "transmission", "asymptomatic", "virus", "hospital", "undergo", "symptoms", "caseload", "updates", "circulating", "precautions", "cdc", "kits", "pandemic", "scott", "california", "populated", "coronavirus", "distancing"]}, {"text": "The coronavirus pandemic is affecting tens of thousands of people in profound ways, including loss of work and a lack of medical care and food supplies.

While each entity is approaching it in its own way and has its own stories of change, one theme is consistent among all: the need for support.  They’re asking people, if able, to place pickup and delivery orders, buy gift cards, shop online or encourage others in their circles to buy local.   Taxes  Three key tax deadlines have moved.  The deadline for filing local February tourism taxes is extended from March 20 to April 20. Penalties and fines won’t be charged if these are filed by the new deadline. And there won’t be any refunds for those already filed, according to a news release from the city. More information on this is available at duluthmn.gov/Finance.  The state of Minnesota extended its February sales and tax deadline by 30 days, but only for the businesses impacted by the governor’s closure mandate. Information on this is available at revenue.state.mn.us/sales-and-use-tax.  The individual federal tax deadline has also been extended to July 15. Find more information about individual tax filings at irs.gov/individuals.   Relief fund  Our local Entrepreneur Fund has set up a fund to support small businesses hit hard by the pandemic. Its Small Business Relief Fund will grant funds up to $5,000 to small businesses in northeast and central Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin.  The Entrepreneur Fund is accepting donations to support the grant. Information about grant applications will be released Monday, which you can access by subscribing to the Entrepreneur Fund’s emails on its website.   Speaking of monetary support  The Small Business Administration’s low-interest disaster loans aren’t available in Minnesota yet, but several lawmakers and entities are working to push through a motion to make them available.

We sort the facts from falsehoods. Wochit  The city of Detroit began testing its first responders, bus drivers and health care workers for COVID-19 on Thursday, using new rapid testing kits that produce results in about 15 minutes.  Detroit is the first city in the country to begin using the kits from Abbott, a global health care company based in Lake County, Illinois, Mayor Mike Duggan has said.  The innovative testing kits will allow quarantined police officers and other first responders who test negative to return to work faster. Otherwise, they would have had to remain quarantined while waiting days for test results.  \"This is the game changer we have been waiting for,\" Duggan said Thursday at his daily media briefing.  The city spent $377,049 on Abbott testing kits, instruments, control swabs and bar code readers, according to the city's purchase order dated March 29. The purchase order did not specify quantities for the equipment, but a Duggan spokesman said the city bought 5,000 kits.  Testing being performed on Abbott’s ID NOW platform.

Metro Detroit is among the country's hardest-hit regions. The city, as of Thursday, had 2,860 positive cases and 97 deaths. Hundreds of police officers have been quarantined and 91 members of the department, as of Wednesday, have tested positive.  Abbott specializes in diagnostics and medical devices. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on March 27 approved the use of Abbott's ID NOW platform to detect COVID-19. The devices are about the size of a toaster.  Duggan spokesman John Roach said he does not yet know whether the city is planning to buy more rapid testing kits to use on residents.  The equipment is useful in outbreak hot spots, Robert Ford, Abbott's president and chief operating officer, said in a statement released upon the FDA's approval.  \"With rapid testing on ID NOW, health care providers can perform molecular point-of-care testing outside the traditional four walls of a hospital in outbreak hot spots,\" Ford said.

A company spokeswoman reached on Thursday confirmed only that the rapid testing equipment had been shipped to Detroit.  Detroit continues to offer drive-through testing for residents and others who have a doctor's prescription at the State Fairgrounds site near 8 Mile Road and Woodward Avenue. About 600 people were tested on Wednesday. Duggan said daily testing could reach 1,000 residents.  The city is in talks with local transportation services to arrange rides for Detroiters who don't have a car. A deal could be reached by Friday, Duggan said.  \"We're going to keep going until we get everybody in this city to have equal access to testing,\" he said.  The city's coronavirus website has more information about how to get tested and how to find a doctor accepting new patients, those with and without insurance.

The conversation touched on the details — and challenges — of remote instruction on all levels, the importance of communicating with parents, how to grade students from afar, and even whether there will be a spring break this year.  And as closing advice, each had a tip for their fellow educators — and parents — that may prove useful.  The following are edited excerpts, and the full discussion can be watched here.   Typical school day  Q: So, tell us about your typical school day these days?  Dr. Danielle Kovach, special education teacher, second and third grades at the Hopatcong School District, New Jersey Teacher of the Year in 2011: The day starts just like every other. I wake up, I make my coffee. I may not always get out of my pajamas first thing in the morning, but I do start with communicating to my parents, sending them an email. I set up a Google Meet for my students, so my students and I meet every morning. We basically have some conversations. First, how are things going? How are things going with their work? We do our calendar. We greet each other, which is harder with video conferencing. But we’re working through those things.  Q: Do all of your students have video capabilities and online capabilities?  Kovach: No, and that’s been a huge challenge, as well. I have students who not only don’t have video capability, they don’t have internet and parents don’t have an email address. So in those cases, I just reach out to the parents directly through phone calls and just checking up as much as I can to make sure that they’re OK and they’re following through with their work.  Dr. Denise King, principal of B. Bernice Young Elementary School in Burlington Township: I’m almost the same world — balancing home, work and school; staying up late hours, making sure that we communicate regularly. I’m on video or phone constantly. This is what I do all day now. I’m used to walking the building on a regular basis, checking in with teachers face to face, hugging students regularly, just making sure that everybody is good. I’m doing that again, but I’m doing it virtually.  So my day begins with plugging in, doing our digital chats with the central administrators, talking with case managers and teachers. And we do family chats. I had a little family chat yesterday and today. And that gives me a sense of the pulse of what’s happening in their world.  Q: What is the pulse, what are you hearing?  King: Well, I would say today is definitely better than it was last week. Parents are juggling, as Danielle said. I have my granddaughter and my mom that live with us also. So I’m balancing that, making sure that I’m helping her with her schoolwork.  Dr. Scott Rocco, superintendent of schools for the Hamilton Township School District and president of the New Jersey Association of School Administrators:  Everybody has risen to the occasion here, no matter what their title or responsibility. And that’s how we’ve made it work. It is better this week than it was last week. We were in true triage mode over the last week-and-a-half or so. And we’re beginning to find a groove of how things are working.  I have three high schools in my district, and so that poses an interesting angle when you’re working K-12. One of the things that we know is that our high school students tend to have more of an opportunity to either have a device and Wi-Fi at home or to have their own smartphone that has data where they can do a lot of the work through their phone or through a device.  That being said, when we started this a week-and-a-half ago, 83% of our students in the district were connected to a device and Wi-Fi. About the end of last week, we were 87%. By the end of yesterday, we had handed out 1,300-plus additional devices, and we are at about 98% of our students now connected on device and Wi-Fi.  Q: Can you speak to what a day’s schedule is like for high schools?  Rocco: I know across the state my colleagues have done all kinds of different things, from having a specific schedule to setting specific times. In Hamilton Township, we have told our students that our teachers will be available between 10 and 2 every day to assist. Teachers are putting up lessons, running video chats, videotaping their own lessons, and making connections to resources that are out there.  What I have found is that the teachers have made themselves available way beyond 10 to 2. Plus, the teachers are putting assignments up, so that the students can do it at their own pace. But they are answering emails all day long, all night long and responding to our students and our parents. And that’s the other nice thing, is that our teachers are responding directly to our parents.  King: That is so true on all levels. Every single person is working above and beyond. So we decided in our district to have Wednesday a “take a breath day,” just to take a moment, to take a breath and just not assign any new assignments. So much is happening that we can’t catch our breath. We want the families to not be so overwhelmed. We want the teachers not to be overwhelmed.   Students with special needs  Q: We have gotten a lot of questions from our audience about the challenges of serving students with special needs and disabilities.  King: That’s an excellent conversation to have. Personally, I am a parent of a young adult with unique abilities. You’re right. We have students who need support. That is what the behavior specialists help with and things that we have done to help a child make progress. To understand the emotional components of what they need is a regular battle. It’s not easy.  Q: Do you worry about loss of learning?  Rocco: Absolutely, every day. For all students.  King: We have parents who are learning themselves with their children. Many of the skills, some of them are not familiar with them. So it’s a learning curve for everybody, especially when they’re not used to using technology to do it. So the learning component of it is different. I know for our lower grade levels, we just decided to go to a pass-fail component for our students.  It’s not for lack of effort by the teachers. They are working hard. They are working hard to do the best that they can in the environment that we have. But think about this: We haven’t really tested a lot of it out over time. So we are just doing it now for the better part of about eight days, nine days. I would say over those nine days, there’s been a lot more success than there has been failure.   Remote report cards  Q: Will grading have to change?  Rocco: It’s a great question. Just yesterday we decided as a central administrative team to move the elementary level to a pass-fail grading system. We’re looking into a pass-fail because what you said is correct. The validity of what’s occurring regarding instruction, we really can’t assess to that because the students are in the home.  Kovach: That is still an unknown for us because all of our students are using paper work. I’ve been encouraging my parents to take a picture if they can send me their work; that way, at least maybe not for grading purposes, but I can check on their progress to see how they’re doing.  Q: How will you decide whether a child will advance? And Dr. Rocco, you have high school kids where class rankings really matter. What are the conversations happening right now around that?  Rocco: We’re having those conversations every day. We’re having it with the principals and supervisors, my directors. We’re going to try and come up with a plan that’s fair and balanced, based on what we have available.  Our teachers are grading work that the students are turning in. They’re doing project-based learning also on top of that. But we have to look at this because it has a long-term effect. It’s not just the seniors who you need a final GPA for when you determine who is Number One and who’s Number Two in the class. But it impacts all four grades, moving forward year after year after year.  Q: Are SATs and ACTs going to happen for the spring?  Rocco: Right now, the SATs and ACTs are postponed. I suspect they’ll probably run some time either end of June or the beginning of July. AP is going to happen and actually be done individually. Kids can take those. College Board has been great with the information they’ve put out. But that’s also going to be different because they’re going to take it from home. And my understanding is it’s predominantly going to be essay-based.   Best practices  Q: Are there one or two best practices that you’ve encountered in just the last couple of weeks that you’d be willing to share?  Kovach: Honestly, the best thing that I’ve found so far that has been the most effective every single day is open lines of communication with parents, especially when you work with children with special needs.  When we speak, when we talk and we communicate or they know that we are there to help them, that has what I have found to be the best help. And I think we as educators need to realize that our parents need a lot of support now. It is just not our students that need support.   Spring break  Q: Is there going to be a spring break this year?  Rocco: Yeah, that’s been one of the biggest questions that we’ve had. I think we need a break from the remote learning, it’s been so new for everybody. We will be three weeks into it. So I think we do need a break. I think that gives parents, that gives children, that gives teachers a needed break to kind of refocus, re-energize and then come back after spring break and be ready to go again.  Q: How long is this sustainable? Can we do this for the rest of the school year, which may be a reality?  Rocco: I have no doubt our teachers and administrators and everybody in the district will rise to the occasion and get it done. And I think that’s across the state and across the country. I think that can be done. We’ll just adapt. We adapt day in and day out and make it work.  King: I agree with Scott. It’s definitely a possibility. We have to do it. I believe throughout our collaborators, our collaboration with our team, with every student, parents and our families and our district stakeholders, we are prepared to do what we need to do to make it effective.  Kovach: Let’s look at it from this way. New Jersey right now is the best in the nation in education. I know that our teachers are thoroughly ready to do this, and we are fully committed to do everything we can to give our students the best education possible, no matter what circumstances we’re under.   One piece of advice  Q: As we close, one tip to educators who are watching this?  Kovach: I would have to say that we have to also take care of ourselves. This is very emotional for us. It’s getting very stressful for us. As teachers, we want to give. We want to give everything of ourselves, but we also need to think of ourselves to make sure we’re getting sleep, make sure that we’re getting some exercise, taking care of ourselves, so that we can take care of our children and our families and know that we’re doing our best.  King: Breathe and laugh. You do have to have a sense of humor. Make sure you stay connected with everybody. It’s a lot going on.  Rocco: I agree with both of them 100%. But I also want to make it very clear to everybody, just as was just said, we will get through this. We will get through this together. I think that’s an important piece we need to understand.

We have documented transmission of various human respiratory viruses to wild gorilla, chimpanzee and bonobo, so it is known that this happens.  “We must avoid transmission of [the coronavirus] to the great apes since it may have a detrimental effect. However, we don’t know as of yet if this virus will cause mild or severe symptoms in great apes.  “We must apply the precautionary principle, as all great apes are already highly endangered in their survival due to habitat loss, poaching and diseases.”  In a social media post, Gorilla Doctors said: “Our work continues in the face of Covid-19. Even with extraordinary lockdown measures in place, the governments of Rwanda, Uganda and DR Congo recognise the critical importance of our gorilla health monitoring.  “Our veterinary staff have received special permission to perform their work in spite of country-wide travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders to fight the spread of Covid-19.”  Sanctuaries for orangutans in Borneo have also been closed to protect the endangered animals from the outbreak.  Professor of primate biology Serge Wich, of John Moores University Liverpool, told The Independent the risks differed somewhat for orangutans and gorillas.  Asked about gorillas in central African countries he said: “Gorillas are largely terrestrial in those countries and often come in relative close contact with tourists and researchers.  “At present tourism has been halted to reduce risk. Researchers have clear protocols to maintain distance which are part of their general procedures. This should all help to reduce risk of transmission. But of course there are also other people entering these forests to collect wood, etc, so that still poses a risk as well.”  “Wild orangutans are largely arboreal so their distance is usually quite large to researchers. But there are several sanctuaries where large numbers of orangutans are kept. At those locations there are also protocols in place to reduce risk.  “There are also other areas where great apes can come into contact with people such as plantations, infrastructure development. Risks in such places are largely not known. Nor are there general protocols in place in all such areas.”  Dr Steve Unwin, a specialist in zoo health management and lecturer in biosystems and environmental change at the University of Birmingham told The Independent an estimated 40 per cent of pathogens are known to be transferable from humans and apes, and as such, strict measures are necessary.  He said: “All NGO and governmental sites involved in captive orangutan management… are taking the precautionary principle route and have stopped all but the most needed veterinary and welfare care of the animals under their care.”  But he said relevant research into respiratory disease in orangutans is pending publication.  “Before [Covid-19] hit, research had begun on pathogenic risk factors in respiratory disease in orangutans. Biosecurity measures were already in place at sites - similar to how good zoos operate - to be better able to assess the real risks from the assumed. That process is ongoing and not yet published.”  The experts also warned the fall in tourism due to the virus could eventually impact protections for great apes.  Professor Wich said: “It could lead to a shortfall for national park authorities but could also have a negative impact on local communities that benefit from tourism as well as owners of hotels and lodges. If those people need to look for alternative sources of income that could increase risk.  “In general a reduction of income due to a lack or reduction of tourism could lead to a decrease in patrols. But countries with great apes are committed to their protection so I trust they will do their utmost to continue protecting them and that is also what we hear from the field where essential patrols seem to continue even under these difficult circumstances. But at some stage financial support might be needed to continue this.”  Dr Herbinger and Dr Leendert added the virus was now “a major threat for projects which rely mainly on income from the tourism industry.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 19, "positive": 36, "negative": 20, "disgust": 2, "joy": 3, "anger": 7, "fear": 6, "trust": 3}, "metadata": ["closures", "humans", "vulnerable", "tourism", "masks", "france", "italy", "getty", "india", "russia", "park", "brazil", "robert", "virus", "infectious", "transmission", "respiratory", "symptoms", "precautionary", "media", "lockdown", "stay-at-home", "professor", "university", "risks", "african", "halted", "researchers", "protocols", "locations", "steve", "environmental", "strict", "sites", "ongoing"]}, {"text": "PAWTUCKET, R.I. (WPRI) ─ As the coronavirus outbreak started ramping up in the United States, Providence resident Josh Maurer was on the road calling games for the Boston College Men’s Basketball Team.  “The previous week, I had been in seven different airports, on eight different airplanes, in two different hotels, in basketball arenas filled with thousands of fans,” he explained. “It was the worst possible week to be doing that.”  Maurer, who is also the play-by-play broadcaster for the Pawtucket Red Sox, returned to Providence on March 12 and decided to self-quarantine because of his travel.  Today, Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott said the number of confirmed cases of #COVID19 doesn't give a full picture of how widespread the disease is in Rhode Island b/c of limited testing.  Tonight on @wpri12 – @JoshMaurerRadio shares how he attempted to get tested in RI and was denied. pic.twitter.com/0Hz3ZpEUkk — Caroline Goggin (@CarolineGoggin) March 27, 2020  “The next morning I bought what I thought was two-weeks worth of groceries and just kind of sheltered in my house,” he said.  But Maurer said he began to feel achy that night. He said he slept for 11 hours and woke up the following morning with a fever.  “Later that day was when I noticed my breathing felt different. Sure enough, looking up what symptoms of COVID-19 are, those are two of the main symptoms,” he said.  Maurer then called the Rhode Island Department of Health’s COVID-19 hotline to see how he should proceed. The representative who answered told him to call his primary care provider.  Since Maurer doesn’t have a primary care provider, he was told to call an urgent care center or a hospital.  “The problem is, the way to get screened, there were guidelines that were given to all the people answering phones at these places,” Maurer explained. “I could tell they were going through checklists. They would ask different questions: Where had I traveled? What exactly were my symptoms? What was the temperature of my fever?”  But the 39-year-old said each time he spoke with an urgent care center or Rhode Island Hospital, he was told there was nothing they could do for him. He wasn’t able to get a test.  “I would list for the people on the phone where I had been. Then, I would get a response, ‘Well, those places aren’t hot spots so we can’t assume you came into contact with anybody,'” he said.  Maurer said he understood the healthcare providers he spoke with were inundated with phone calls. But after 10 days of being sick, he grew frustrated with the fact he was repeatedly being denied a test for COVID-19.  “The reason I wanted to get a test was two-fold. I had traveled so much, and I had come into contact with so many people the previous week, I wanted to let them know,” he explained.  The second reason? Maurer said he wanted to confirm whether he was properly recovering.  After more attempts to get tested, Maurer took to Twitter. Because of a series of tweets, he found some interesting news.  Its likely that the situation in your community is worse than you realize at the moment. Thanks for reading and letting me get this off my chest! Stay safe and healthy! (9/9). — Josh Maurer (@JoshMaurerRadio) March 23, 2020  “I got a message after I sent those tweets out from a friend of mine who works for Princeton University,” he said. “He had hired me to broadcast the Princeton versus Brown men’s basketball game at the end of February.”  That friend informed Maurer that the man he called the game with, who is from New York City, had tested positive for COVID-19. When Maurer heard the news, he said that was his “aha moment,” when he finally figured out who he came in contact with that had the virus.  “The great news is I really feel like I’ve come through it,” Maurer said. “It’s been a couple of days since I had a fever. My breathing feels so much better.”  Maurer said he wants people to take this illness seriously, and he also wants testing in Rhode Island to be increased as soon as possible.  “The limited available tests in the state should be and are reserved for people who have severe cases and healthcare workers. I totally understand that,” he explained. “The issue is there’s not enough testing. There need to be more tests. I don’t think it’s our governor’s fault or our lawmakers’ faults. I truly believe that from the beginning of this epidemic, we just weren’t prepared enough.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 9, "positive": 21, "negative": 4, "joy": 5, "anger": 6, "fear": 3, "trust": 2}, "metadata": ["coronavirus", "outbreak", "united", "resident", "calling", "college", "pawtucket", "ri", "symptoms", "hotline", "healthcare", "providers", "repeatedly"]}, {"text": " Photo : Getty  In dealing with the drastic supply shortage being wreaked amid the current coronavirus crisis, seemingly every manufacturer is chipping in to do their part. Rum factories are producing hand sanitizer. Companies better known for building sex furniture are pivoting to medical-grade face masks. And some of the biggest automakers around have offered to pitch in to churn out ventilators from their factories. (Though capitalism may get in the way of that last one.) And now we’re starting to seeing Dyson volunteer to help with the shortage as well.   Advertisement  As CNN’s London Bureau reports, Dyson—a company better known for its vacuums and flat irons—is on track to create thousands of ventilators that are “designed to address the specific clinical needs of COVID-19 patients,” as company CEO James Dyson told employees in an internal email.   Advertisement  The CoVent, as the device will be called, came as the result of a request from UK Prime Minister—and notable coronavirus patient—Boris Johnson, directly to Dyson, just over a week ago. Per the initial letter to employees, the company is on track to pump out a round of 10,000 of these portable, battery-powered bed-mounted devices for the country’s federal efforts, with an additional 5,000 scheduled to be shipped for donation, both in the UK and internationally. As one company spokesperson told CNN, the ventilators are on track to be ready for prime time by “early April.”  This news comes on the heels of Johnson’s about-face over the country’s response to the current international pandemic. The UK’s initial response was to seemingly allow the bulk of the population to just... get the virus and see what happens. Heavy criticism (and the potential for “hundreds of thousands of deaths”) caused the prime minister to reverse course, calling for a national lockdown in an effort to slow the virus’s spread.  In a radio interview with the BBC earlier today, the UK’s business minister, Alok Sharma, said that ventilators made by Dyson and any other manufacturers need to meet regulatory snuff before being ready for use by the country’s health services. When asked about the April deadline, Sharma reportedly told the BBC that UK regulators wanted to see prototypes coming forward in the coming weeks.  Meanwhile, in the U.S., our own weird version of James Dyson is supposedly working on manufacturing ventilators as well. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday night that he’d spoken with Elon Musk on the phone and the Tesla CEO had vowed to donate “hundreds” of ventilators to the city in order to help with the shortage. It’s estimated that NYC needs about 30,000 additional ventilators. When or if Musk will actually follow through with that promise remains to be seen.

UCSC, as well as hospitals and county agencies, are restricting visitors, instilling good hygiene practices and informing residents how to stop the spread of the coronavirus, campus officials said.  Two Genomics Institute staff members visited the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s Bay Area facility Feb. 27 in Redwood City. After that visit, the employees learned that a family member of a contract worker who was also working at the facility that day has tested positive for the coronavirus. An analysis found that neither of the two Genomics Institute staff were among the seven individuals who had close enough contact with the infected contract worker, according to a statement released Friday from UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive. Both UCSC employees have self-quarantined and are pursuing options for testing.  While the employees are in quarantine, there were no confirmed cases as of Friday afternoon of the coronavirus in the county, according to Corinne Hyland, health services manager for the county Health Services Agency.  Apart from the Genomics Institute staff, one student receiving medical care off campus was tested Wednesday for the coronavirus after experiencing respiratory symptoms. That test came back negative on Thursday, according to Larive’s statement. UC Santa Cruz moved the student’s two roommates into quarantine housing after learning about the testing, but when the test came back negative, they returned to their on-campus residence.  UC President Janet Napolitano issued a letter Thursday expanding restrictions to international travel, in accordance with recent Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidance, to Japan. Students must receive approval from campus Risk Services. Anyone who travels to China, South Korea, Italy, Iran or Japan must self-quarantine for 14 days before returning to campus.  In coordination with Santa Cruz County Health Services and the California Department of Public Health, UCSC is not planning to cancel classes or suspend or modify operations at this time.   Dignity Health Dominican Hospital  Dignity Health Dominican Hospital announced Thursday that it has implemented visitor restrictions to prevent COVID-19, the coronavirus, and other flu-like illnesses from spreading. Effective Thursday, all visitors must be at least 16 years old, each patient can only have one visitor per day and patients and visitors can only enter through the hospital main entrance or the Emergency Department. All other entrances are only for employee access.  The restricted visitor policy will be lifted as soon as possible, according to a Dignity Health press release.  Emergency Department patients experiencing fever, cough, sore throat, body aches and/or nasal congestion are required to wear masks at all times. Individuals who want to visit someone in the hospital but are experiencing any of these symptoms are asked to visit another day when they are symptom-free for at least 48 hours.  Dignity Health encourages people to wash their hands frequently, use hand sanitizer and avoid touching their face. Hospital officials urge people with flu-like symptoms to stay home and consult first with their primary care physician.   County emergency  Santa Cruz County Health Officer Dr. Gail Newel issued a Declaration of Local Health Emergency Wednesday.  “In a short period of time, coronavirus has been found throughout the Bay Area, including several of our neighboring counties. We have been coordinating our preparation efforts for COVID-19, and the time has come to elevate our preparedness efforts to the next step,” said County Administrative Officer Carlos Palacios in a county press release.  Palacios will formally ask the County Board of Supervisors to declare a local emergency for the coronavirus and vote on that declaration at the supervisor’s meeting Tuesday.  Declaring a Local Health Emergency also allows the county to access funding to support efforts to fight the outbreak.  The county’s Emergency Operations Center is supporting the Health Services Agency’s Departmental Operations Center, which manages the community response to the coronavirus under Newel’s direction.  Testing for the coronavirus is coordinated by the California Department of Public Health in coordination with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No local tests are available. The county recommends residents refrain from asking their local providers for tests unless they are directed to do so by a medical professional. If individuals have a health concern, the county suggests contacting their primary care physician or calling 211 for help finding a clinic.  Eleven California public health labs have already received CDC test kits and have begun testing, according to the California Department of Public Health. These labs are in Richmond, as well as Alameda, Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Francisco, Santa Clara, Tulare, Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties. Up to 20 public health labs will be available in the coming weeks.   Sutter Health  In each Palo Alto Medical Foundation care centers in the county, staff has posted signs that list the symptoms of the coronavirus and directs anyone experiencing these symptoms to call a representative that will screen them with a telephone questionnaire. Sutter Health is also restricting access to its facilities for visitors who show signs of illness.  Community members who use Sutter Health’s meeting space received notice Friday that the health organization is restricting facility access for anyone showing signs of illness and will ask them to leave, according to Emma Dugas, Sutter Health media relations coordinator.  Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office  The Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office announced Wednesday it is temporarily stopping jail tours, screening individuals brought to the main jail and stopping contact visits at the agency’s facilities. The Sheriff’s Office is doing this to protect its incarcerated individuals, staff and visitors. Visits at the Rountree and Blaine Street facilities are also suspended and visitors must be screened, but inmates can still have visitors in the non-contact rooms, according to Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Ashley Keehn.  “We are taking proactive steps to minimize any potential threat to those not only living in our facilities, but also working there or coming to visit,” said Sheriff Jim Hart in a press release.  As of Friday afternoon, no confirmed cases of the coronavirus were at the jail, according to Keehn.   Loch Lomond Recreation Area  Effective Monday, the city of Santa Cruz Water Department will reduce the days that the Loch Lomond Recreation Area is open to the public to Friday, Saturdays and Sundays. Qualified watershed staff are revisiting critical water system operations to ensure they are reliable in case a local outbreak of the coronavirus occurs. Watershed personnel are being cross-trained to support water production if an outbreak happens and impacts staffing.  This action is in response to the county’s declaration of a Local Health Emergency. The Water Department will re-evaluate park hours as the health emergency continues.  Loch Lomond will maintain regular hours of 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays through March, increasing hours to 7 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. in April.  The Santa Cruz Water Department serves water to 96,000 customers, processes 6 million to 8 million gallons of water per day, manages 4,000 acres of watershed lands, oversees 300 miles of distribution lines, runs a state-certified water quality laboratory and provides summertime recreation activities at the Loch Lomond Reservoir and Recreation Area.   Threshold Enterprises Ltd.  Scotts Valley nutritional supplement company Threshold Enterprises Ltd. has launched Virtual Expo West, a video tour of its booth and brands. Threshold made this decision after the Natural Products Expo West, a five-day health product exhibition scheduled for March, was postponed to mid-April due to concerns of the spread of the coronavirus.

About 150 people gathered at a camp near Alice Springs and refused police orders to disperse. At one point, about 60 members of the group became aggressive towards the police and started throwing bottles. Police Commissioner Jamie Chalker expressed his disappointment at the behaviour of the large group following a disturbance at Charles Creek camp at Alice Springs. Police arrived to the camp about 3 this morning to see about 150 people gathering and displaying anti-social behaviour. Police were explaining the restrictions relating to the COVID-19 virus and mass gatherings, when a group of around 60 people became aggressive towards police and started to throw bottles. Police disengaged and requested further assistance. The group dispersed as more police arrived. Commissioner Jamie Chalker said this conduct towards police and reports of rocks being thrown at a St John ambulance and a taxi are completely unacceptable. \"Frontline responders are leading the way to ensure the safety of people and to save lives. \"We have no time for ignorance. We need everyone to bond together. \"Mass gatherings go completely against the national messaging and the high importance that everyone is placing around self-quarantine at the moment, ensuring appropriate social distancing. \"The sad reality is, the many moves we are making are based on the fact we know there is a vulnerable cohort living in the Northern Territory.

It is caused by a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans and easily spread from person to person. There is currently no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment for this disease.  On March 10, 2020, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services identified the first two presumptive-positive cases of COVID-19 in Michigan. On that same day, I issued Executive Order 2020-4.

To mitigate the spread of COVID-19, protect the public health, and provide essential protections to vulnerable Michiganders, it is reasonable and necessary to impose limited and temporary restrictions on the use of places of public accommodation.  Executive Order 2020-9 imposed such restrictions. This order changes those restrictions by clarifying their application to facilities offering non-essential personal care services. When the restrictions in this order take effect, Executive Order 2020-9 is rescinded.  Acting under the Michigan Constitution of 1963 and Michigan law, I order the following:  Beginning as soon as possible but no later than March 22, 2020 at 9:00 am, and continuing until April 13, 2020 at 11:59 pm, the following places of public accommodation are closed to ingress, egress, use, and occupancy by members of the public:  Restaurants, food courts, cafes, coffeehouses, and other places of public accommodation offering food or beverage for on-premises consumption;  Bars, taverns, brew pubs, breweries, microbreweries, distilleries, wineries, tasting rooms, special licensees, clubs, and other places of public accommodation offering alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption;  Hookah bars, cigar bars, and vaping lounges offering their products for on-premises consumption;  Theaters, cinemas, and indoor and outdoor performance venues;   Libraries and museums;  Gymnasiums, fitness centers, recreation centers, indoor sports facilities, indoor exercise facilities, exercise studios, and facilities offering non-essential personal care services;  Casinos licensed by the Michigan Gaming Control Board, racetracks licensed by the Michigan Gaming Control Board, and Millionaire Parties licensed by the Michigan Gaming Control Board; and  Places of public amusement not otherwise listed above.  Places of public accommodation subject to this section are encouraged to offer food and beverage using delivery service, window service, walk-up service, drive-through service, or drive-up service, and to use precautions in doing so to mitigate the potential transmission of COVID-19, including social distancing. In offering food or beverage, a place of public accommodation subject to this section may permit up to five members of the public at one time in the place of public accommodation for the purpose of picking up their food or beverage orders, so long as those individuals are at least six feet apart from one another while on premises.  This section does not prohibit an employee, contractor, vendor, or supplier of a place of public accommodation from entering, exiting, using, or occupying that place of public accommodation in their professional capacity.  The restrictions imposed by this order do not apply to any of the following:  Places of public accommodation that offer food and beverage not for on-premises consumption, including grocery stores, markets, convenience stores, pharmacies, drug stores, and food pantries, other than those portions of the place of public accommodation subject to the requirements of section 1;  Health care facilities, residential care facilities, congregate care facilities, and juvenile justice facilities;  Crisis shelters or similar institutions; and  Food courts inside the secured zones of airports.  For purposes of this order:  “Non-essential personal care services” includes but is not limited to hair, nail, tanning, massage, traditional spa, tattoo, body art, and piercing services, and similar personal care services that require individuals to be within six feet of each other. This does not include services necessary for medical treatment as determined by a licensed medical provider.  “Place of public accommodation” means a business, or an educational, refreshment, entertainment, or recreation facility, or an institution of any kind, whether licensed or not, whose goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations are extended, offered, sold, or otherwise made available to the public. Place of public accommodation also includes the facilities of private clubs, including country clubs, golf clubs, boating or yachting clubs, sports or athletic clubs, and dining clubs.  “Place of public amusement” means a place of public accommodation that offers indoor services or facilities, or outdoor services or facilities involving close contact of persons, for amusement or other recreational or entertainment purposes. A place of public amusement includes an amusement park, arcade, bingo hall, bowling alley, indoor climbing facility, skating rink, trampoline park, and other similar recreational or entertainment facilities.  The director of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Michigan Liquor Control Commission, and the executive director of the Michigan Gaming Control Board must issue orders and directives and take other actions pursuant to law as necessary to implement this order.  This order does not alter any of the obligations under law of an employer affected by this order to its employees or to the employees of another employer.  Consistent with MCL 10.33 and MCL 30.405(3), a willful violation of this order is a misdemeanor.  On March 22, 2020 at 9:00 am, Executive Order 2020-9 is rescinded.

Click here for the latest coronavirus news, which the BDN has made free for the public. You can support this mission by purchasing a digital subscription.  The first Maine person to test positive for the new coronavirus that has infected more than 1,000 across the U.S. and killed more than two dozen in the country is a Navy reservist who traveled while on duty to Italy, where the virus is widespread.  The COVID-19 virus was detected in a woman in her 50s in Androscoggin County, Gov. Janet Mills announced at a Thursday news conference. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention is now in communication with her and her medical provider, and she has been quarantined at home.  The Maine CDC received the woman’s presumptive positive test result around 11 a.m. Thursday, according to the agency’s director, Dr. Nirav Shah. A presumptive positive test means that a state test came back positive, but has not been confirmed by a federal lab.  “She is not hospitalized,” Shah said.  [Do you have questions about the coronavirus? Ask us here.]  Investigators from the Maine CDC are now working with the woman to determine where she has traveled and how much contact she has had with other people. Maine CDC spokesman Robert Long said the Navy reservist had traveled on a mission to a country where the virus has spread.  The U.S. Navy released statements saying the Maine reservist traveled to Italy and that other people “the individual immediately identified having close contact with have been notified and are in self-isolation at their residence.”  The Sun Journal first reported that the woman is from Auburn and had recently traveled to Italy. She was picked up at the Portland Jetport last Friday by her friend, Michelle Roberts, who runs a Lewiston day care, the paper reported. Roberts has closed the day care while she is in quarantine until later this month, the paper reported.  “She started feeling like she had a cold,” Roberts told the Sun Journal. “You know, regular sniffling and of course, you’re coming back from a trip and you’re tired and whatever. Is jet lag and time change and all that good stuff? You’re thinking you’re just exhausted from travel.”  Roberts said she convinced her friend to get screened when the symptoms got worse. The woman came into Central Maine Medical Center’s emergency department in Lewiston on Tuesday and was tested, said Central Maine Healthcare spokeswoman Kate Carlisle. Central Maine Medical Center is part of the Central Maine Healthcare system.  “The patient had been in self-quarantine with respiratory symptoms,” Carlisle said.  Carlisle said other patients have come through the emergency department with respiratory symptoms, but they were so low-risk they were not tested.  The state had tested a total of 86 people for the virus as of Thursday evening, including 65 whose samples came back negative and 20 whose results were still not available, according to the Maine CDC website.  With the confirmed arrival of the virus in Maine, it is likely that public and private entities around the state will take additional precautions to prevent the spread of a disease that has forced large universities to cancel classes, stranded whole cruise ships offshore and prompted President Donald Trump to restrict travel to the U.S. from 26 European countries for 30 days.  The University of Maine System, Bowdoin College in Brunswick and Colby College in Waterville have already instructed students not to return to campus after spring break and to prepare to complete their semesters remotely.  [Here’s what has been canceled or postponed in Maine due to coronavirus]  Since originating in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019, the coronavirus has spread to at least 115 countries, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University. More than 1,300 cases of the virus were reported in the U.S. as of Thursday morning, including at least 38 deaths related to it.  Maine was the last New England state to confirm a case of the virus. Ninety-five confirmed cases were reported in Massachusetts as of Wednesday. New Hampshire and Rhode Island had each reported 5, Connecticut had reported 3 and Vermont had reported 2, according to the Johns Hopkins. There was also one reported case in the Canadian province of New Brunswick.

The Maine CDC also started conducting its own tests for COVID-19 at the end of last week with testing kits provided by the U.S. CDC. Before last week, it had conducted just one test for COVID-19 that came back negative.  As with the common cold or influenza, COVID-19 spreads when an infected person coughs or exhales, emitting small droplets, according to the World Health Organization. People who have COVID-19 have shown flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough and shortness of breath. The infection might also spread before people show symptoms, according to the CDC.

On Friday, Capital & Coast District Health Board chief executive Fionnagh Dougan said Regional Public Health was working with the nurse, who to trace any community contacts.  The nurse had been wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) but it was not yet known how the nurse contracted the virus.

The Ministry of Health continued to investigate the other half of cases, she said.  When it came to the Wellington nurse, the ministry had not yet fully investigated the source of infection but encouraged and supported the use of PPE by healthcare workers, she said.

'NURSING STAFF NOT TO BLAME'  In a statement, the New Zealand Nurses Organisation (NZNO) said it was disappointed nurses and other healthcare staff were being blamed for bringing coronavirus into the workplace without any real evidence - or that the problem was staff were not using personal protective equipment properly.  This has been raised in relation to Waikato Hospital and aged care sites in Canterbury but healthcare workers across the country felt blamed rather than supported, the organisation said.  NZNO's kaiwhakahaere Kerri Nuku said \"the assertion that more than half of the Covid-19-positive health care staff in Aotearoa New Zealand contracted the virus outside work is not at all believable, and our members are surprised such things are being said\".  \"It's a suggestion that comes at a convenient time for employers in DHBs and Aged Care, who were being so roundly criticised over inadequate PPE availability.\"  Healthcare workers were also being branded as careless or unskilled.  \"Nurses and caregivers are dedicated and compassionate, and courageously turn up to work where many of us wouldn't, so to diminish that by blaming them in the middle of a very distressing situation is a very big and uncharitable call.\"  Infection was much more likely to have come from contact with patients or from within the workplace environment itself, Nuku said.  \"This underscores the need for the full PPE nurses have been demanding (including hair nets and shoe covers) – and which some staff, who have become infected, were explicitly told not to wear.\"  Nuku said nurses and caregivers had told the organisation they feared for their whānau and communities.

STAFF DEALING WITH COVID-19 PATIENTS SAY THEY ARE GIVEN REGULAR MASKS  The Ministry of Health recently announced it would be running a new national distribution model which would help remedy some of the problems reported about personal protective equipment.  Previously, a nurse employed by the district health board told Stuff that some workers were only given N95 masks when performing an aerosol generating procedure on a Covid-19 patient.  Workers dealing with the general care of Covid-19 patients were given regular surgical masks, she said, which had lead to her and other staff to worry they would contract the virus.  At the time, Capital & Coast District Health Board chief medical officer John Tait said in most situations, N95 masks did not provide better protection against Covid-19 than a surgical mask.  \"The only time when N95 masks are important is with Covid-19 patients who are receiving aerosolising generating procedures (e.g. during intubation).  \"We have shared this information with our staff as part of ongoing discussions on the best use of masks in New Zealand, which differs from overseas.\"  As of Friday, there had been 1409 confirmed cases of coronavirus in New Zealand.

Although the Covid-19 disease outbreak has now affected more than 70 countries around the world, numerous media outlets have associated the coronavirus with Asians, often using photography portraying them as the “face” of the crisis.  While the outbreak started in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, it has reached every continent except Antarctica, according to the latest count by Al Jazeera. In the United States, there have been more than 160 confirmed cases of the virus. To be clear, the outbreak is not confined to — nor can be blamed on — Asian people.  Yet on Sunday, Forbes published a photo of an Asian person wearing a mask to report that New York had confirmed its first coronavirus patient (it has since updated the article and changed the photo). On the same day, on a story on the first case in Scotland, Metro used a photograph of an Asian tourist in a mask visiting a castle. The New York Times has also used images like these, although readers have reported that they were later changed to more neutral photos.  In one case, the photo used wasn’t even in the right location. In reporting on Manhattan’s first confirmed coronavirus case, the New York Post on Sunday used a picture of an Asian man wearing a face mask in Queens. This decision was made even though the affected person was actually a Manhattan woman in her 30s who contracted the virus from Iran.  First case of coronavirus confirmed in Manhattan https://t.co/DHZ5uROtAa pic.twitter.com/6NfATbDFT6 — New York Post (@nypost) March 2, 2020  Kainaz Amaria, Vox’s visuals editor who has been recognized for her ethical practices within photojournalism, says the repeated use of these photos could add to the xenophobia Asians are already facing due to the outbreak. “In regard to editorial accuracy, meaning how close does the photography relate to the content of the story, this picture is from a different location and does not relate to any element of the story,” she says. “As picture editors, we need to apply what we know about the history of xenophobia and public health into our editorial decisions when it comes to stories about coronavirus.”  As Merlin Chowkwanyun, historian and assistant professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, recently told Vox, xenophobia has been intertwined with public health discourse for a very long time, against many different groups. “Historically, in both popular and scientific discourse, contagious disease has often been linked, in a blanket way, to population groups thought to be ‘outsiders,’” he said.  And Natalia Molina, a professor of history and American studies at the University of Southern California, told Vox’s Sean Illing that society has “always used race as an organizing principle to define problems in the economy, problems in the culture, problems in the political domain. When there’s a pandemic or any kind of health crisis, our existing ideas about race naturally shape how we process and frame the situation.”  Using photos like the Post did only further spreads cultural alienation by validating racist tropes that not only contribute to hostility toward and bigotry against Asian people but also threaten public health. Since the coronavirus outbreak began, there have been innumerable examples of xenophobia directed toward Asian American communities — including refusing to patronize Asian-owned or -staffed businesses, verbal harassment, racist statements from institutions like the University of California Berkeley, and physical assault.  Amaria says that for these kinds of stories — ones mired in issues of identity and discrimination — news outlets must ask themselves, “Are the photographs further stigmatizing a particular community or perpetuating stereotypes?” Defaulting to using photos of Asian Americans or scenes in Chinatowns to report broadly on the coronavirus pandemic “is an editorially and ethically questionable decision,” she adds.  Instead of falling back on Asian faces, Amaria says it’s the media’s responsibility to show how numerous, diverse communities are shifting their behavior to stay safe — as well as to include images of federal and local officials, medical professionals, and efforts being made by the World Health Organization. “Showing a variety of images that reinforces this collective public health emergency can go a long way toward the public working together as opposed to feeling scared of each other,” she says.  When it comes to culturally sensitive, diverse, and ethical photographs, media outlets must also consider the background of the newswire agencies they rely on, including AP, Getty Images, Reuters, and more. In September 2018, Amaria reported on how many of these agencies are not representative of our growing diverse audience. “News photographs can, and often do, show us what biases mainstream media has,” she says. “Editors decide what communities get attention and what type of attention they get. All too often, underrepresented communities get attention when there is a crisis — creating a sense of ‘otherness.’ All journalists need to be attuned to this aspect of our tradition.”  For news outlets that want to prevent spreading harmful tropes and threatening public health, Amaria recommends following the Asian American Journalism Association’s guidelines on how to ensure accurate and fair portrayal of Asians and Asian Americans.  And in the Vox newsroom, Amaria said she stresses that “if a story is sensitive and/or depicts an underrepresented community then I’d like to have a conversation about our visual decisions before the story is published and promoted.”  “Having a good culture of collaboration and constructive criticism can go a long way” toward employees feeling safe and comfortable enough to raise these concerns, she says.  Media consumers can also use their voices to help stop these unethical photojournalism practices. For example, Claire Trần went viral this week for making fun of the irrelevant and blatantly biased photos by demanding that outlets “at least make us look hot.”  “Newsrooms and journalists are getting the message, and in some cases news outlets like the New York Times have been forced to respond to concerns from their audience,” Amaria says, referring to the paper publishing a graphic photo of dead bodies in Nairobi last year that many found insensitive and disturbing.  While feedback does matter, the ultimate responsibility of ethical journalism shouldn’t lie with readers. “Journalists need to be attuned to their biases. We all have them and must work to reverse the harmful stereotypes our point of view has created,” Amaria says. “We need to retrain ourselves to better reflect a diverse audience.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 19, "positive": 29, "negative": 11, "disgust": 2, "joy": 5, "anger": 15, "fear": 11, "trust": 6}, "metadata": ["coronavirus", "outbreak", "media", "wuhan", "united", "photo", "metro", "reporting", "virus", "professor", "columbia", "scientific", "studies", "university", "southern", "sean", "pandemic", "racist", "california", "americans", "getty", "crisis", "spreading", "harmful", "recommends", "ensure", "claire", "viral", "feedback"]}, {"text": "Lindsay. Photo: Alex Edelman/AFP via Getty Images  The $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package hit a minor snag on Wednesday afternoon when four Republican senators gave a press conference objecting to its unemployment insurance provisions, noting that in some cases the $600-per-week enhancement to unemployment benefits in the package would mean workers who become unemployed could collect benefits that exceed the wages they used to earn. Senators Lindsay Graham, Ben Sasse, Rick Scott, and Tim Scott are concerned that such a high level of benefits would encourage people to stay out of work and collect benefits instead.  Of course, the point of this rescue package is to address a situation where people are being put out of work for good reason. We want many people to stay home instead of working, and so if these benefits help them do that, that’s a feature rather than a bug. But the senators pointed to a few scenarios where discouraging work could lead problematic consequences, even in this extremely unusual environment.  They are worried that employers who would otherwise keep employees on the payroll during a shutdown will instead take advantage of these enhanced benefits and lay workers off, letting the government handle their payroll bill. They are concerned that workers in industries where we want to maintain or increase the workforce during the crisis — such as health care — might be inclined to become unemployed and claim benefits, and that could lead to a shortage of workers with critical skills. And they are concerned that as the crisis abates, people won’t go back to work quickly enough because they can continue to collect generous benefits by staying unemployed.  These objections don’t make a lot of sense to me. I’ll take the last one first: These enhanced benefits are temporary; they run only until the end of the year, and any given worker can only claim them for four months. We will continue to have virus-mitigation measures that create mass unemployment for a significant period, and even after those measures can be relaxed through much of the country, it will take some time for employers to re-ingest all the previously laid-off workers. In fact, it’s likely that the shutdowns will persist long enough that the enhanced benefits will need to be extended. If we’re in a situation by July where all the shutdowns are over and employers are eagerly hiring and our biggest concern is too many people don’t want to go back to work, I will be overjoyed and very surprised.  As for shortages of workers by sector, it’s important to remember these are unemployment benefits, and you generally have to have been laid off to claim them. If you are a hospital technician who would like to collect an unemployment check instead of working, you’ll have to try to talk your employer into laying you off, which seems unlikely at a time when your employer needs all hands on deck. There may be exceptions to the rule that you need to be laid off: As Brandon Arnold of the conservative National Taxpayers’ Union notes, citing draft bill text, the package may allow certain workers to claim unemployment benefits if the coronavirus crisis forces them to stop going to work, even if they haven’t been laid off. But trying to take advantage of that would be a risky proposition for a worker, who would have to quit and then hope to qualify for benefits under that provision, without knowing in advance how it would be applied. And the enhanced benefits, again, would last for only four months — who wants to quit a job now to maybe collect a few months of benefits and then hope to get rehired during a possible economic depression? I’m not saying these benefits could not theoretically be gamed by anyone, but an advantage of a temporary program is that by the time the participants have learned how to game the system, the system is gone.  Employers who are concerned about losing needed workers also have an option available to retain them: They can raise pay. I realize this prescription makes more sense in some industries than others. In necessity-focused parts of the retail sector, sales are up and so employers are in a good position to hand out raises as they try to retain and even hire staff. Walmart and Amazon have already raised pay during the crisis. If good unemployment benefits put even more upward pressure on grocery workers’ wages at a time when they face unusual health risk from going to work, that seems fine to me. Some other sectors, like health care, may be less able to retain workers by raising pay, because their revenues are pressured at the same time that staffing demands are increasing. (Hospitals are canceling lucrative elective surgeries at the same time they are slammed with COVID-19 patients.) But these big financial pressures on the health-care system are why the rescue package also contains a lot of funding for hospitals. And again, because the enhanced unemployment benefits are very temporary, quite possibly more temporary than unemployment itself, I am skeptical that the promise of such benefits is likely to induce many workers to quit their jobs, especially skilled workers.  The senators’ first concern — that owners of idled businesses are likely to lean on the enhanced benefits to shift payroll costs onto the federal government — is the only one that I think likely to be borne out frequently. But I don’t see it as a problem. Other countries, like the United Kingdom and Denmark, are explicitly enacting this as public policy, having the government pay private payrolls. They’re doing so because in many cases, the counterfactual isn’t the business owner paying workers out of his or her own pocket; it’s the business owner laying off workers anyway and those workers subsisting on benefits that replace a much lower percentage of their income. Most businesses, especially small ones, are not capitalized to keep paying their employees for weeks on end without actually doing business. The point of this rescue package is to rescue those businesses and their employees from the costs of an involuntary shutdown; if firms lay their employees off, let them collect enhanced benefits, and then rehire them when they reopen their doors, the rescue package will be working like it is supposed to.  Finally, I would note that the senators’ proposed fix to this bill does not address the objections they lay out. They are concerned that these benefits will cause some workers to prefer not working over working, and they want to fix that by ensuring nobody can earn an unemployment benefit that exceeds what he or she made by working. How would that limit abolish the purported incentive problem? I would think you could find some workers who would gladly take 90 percent of their current pay if it meant not having to work. There’s nothing magic about the 100 percent line.  Work incentives are just such an odd place to focus one’s attention right now. Currently, we need less work in America. It’s a very odd situation that calls for an odd set of policies. We don’t need to worry too much about what these policies would do in a normal economy, because they won’t be in effect when the economy is normal again. The senators’ remarks on Wednesday made it seem like they could not grasp the temporary nature of this situation or the policies in the rescue package.  “If we do something now that says the new baseline American assumption is … we want people to get more money to not work than to work, the American people don’t want that to happen,” said Senator Sasse. Okay. Fine. We all agree this temporary program is not a new baseline — it’s temporary, and unemployment benefits will revert to being less generous when this crisis is over. So what were the objections again?

Murphy, chief executive officer of Arkansas Heart Hospital (Arkansas Democrat-Gazette/John Sykes Jr.)  With its grand, two-story living room, gathering area off the kitchen and meandering back porch that overlooks the lake, Belle Maison is the perfect vehicle to showcase the work of some of the state's most talented designers -- work that could be described as, well, music to the eyes.  Williams' relationship with the Arkansas Symphony Orchestra came about through Virginia Flynn Crow and Dr. Joe Crow, who took the Williamses to the symphony a year or so ago.  \"I was really impressed,\" Williams says. \"The symphony is a teamwork concept, just like heart surgery is. A little bigger, a little bigger crowd. It's more like a hospital. But the symphony seems like a nice thing for us to have here in town.  \"Between that and Larry [West] encouraging us\" to donate their home as a Designer House site, the Williamses thought this would be a good opportunity for Belle Maison to undergo needed updates. \"So we jumped in there,\" Williams says. \"But moving all your stuff out of your house is not a minor event.\" It took about five months to move everything out of the home.  \"We have stuff spread around the county,\" Williams says. \"I hope we find it all.\"  Hosted by the Arkansas Symphony Orchestra Guild, the house was originally set to open to the public for tours April 10-May 10, with several ancillary events scheduled throughout that period. Due to the covid-19 outbreak and resulting cautionary measures passed by federal, state and city authorities, the tours have been postponed. New dates have yet to be announced. \"We are deeply indebted to the Williamses for allowing us to extend our stay on their property until we are able to safely host tours and events,\" spokeswoman Jane Dennis wrote in an email.  A MAN WITH HEARTDonating his home for charity fundraising isn't all for which Williams, 79, is owed a hearty thanks.  \"Dr. Williams is the father of modern cardiovascular surgery here for our state,\" says Dr. Bruce E. Murphy, chief executive officer of Arkansas Heart Hospital. \"[He] has had a very illustrious career, mainly reflected in the fact that he's operated on [literal] generations of families that had coronary disease and valvular heart disease in Arkansas. He was successful in that there was almost nothing he wouldn't take on.\"  Murphy also describes Williams as \"a kind of an old fashioned ... doctor that rounded on his patients twice a day, sat on their bed, talked to them for 10 to 15, 20 minutes, knew his patients well ... and was able to, frankly, have unbelievable outcomes for many years.\"  Dr. Joe Bates -- associate dean for public health practice at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences' Fay Boozman College of Public Health, professor of epidemiology at the college and senior adviser to the secretary of health -- describes Williams as \"a highly accomplished surgeon and an excellent diagnostician.\"  That's a notable legacy, especially considering that Williams not only harbored no childhood dreams of becoming a doctor but went to medical school on a suggestion.  Raised in Booneville, Williams was born one of five children of Paul X. Williams, a lawyer, judge and politician, and Frances Elizabeth Hays Williams, a mother who was a dietitian at the state tuberculosis sanatorium in Booneville.  During Williams' childhood, his father went off to fight in World War II. \"I was partially raised by the woman that lived across the street,\" he remembers. That woman, Inez Radford, had been a college professor on the East Coast but had moved back to town to take care of her aging parents.  She taught Williams how to read. \"When I got ready to go to school, they sent me down to the schoolhouse and handed me a little reader and said, 'Read [in] this book as far as you can.' I got to the mid-10th-grade level and they said, 'We're starting you in the second grade, boy.' I was the littlest kid in my class for a really long time.\" Also a piano teacher, Radford even taught Williams to play. Her influence was such, Williams says, that \"I always had to make all A's. ... You set your own curve, I think.\"  But it wasn't all academics for Williams. Growing up in a little town, he played multiple sports ... football, baseball, basketball. \"If you didn't, it wouldn't be enough people on the team,\" he quips. He also ran track and even played in the school band.  After his high school graduation, Williams headed to the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, not knowing what he wanted to do in life. Meanwhile, he'd enlisted in the Arkansas National Guard. One summer at Guard camp, Williams' family doctor, who happened to be the commanding officer, asked the young undergraduate student why he hadn't considered going to medical school.  \"I said 'Well, because I never thought about it.' He said, 'Check it out.'\"  A STAR (PHYSICIAN) IS BORN  So Williams signed up for premedical courses the next semester. He found himself enjoying the classes and at home among his professors and classmates.  \"The quickest you could get into med school was to get 100 hours of college in three years behind you,\" Williams says. \"So at 21, I was in med school.\" He was the next to youngest student at what is now UAMS.  After earning his medical degree in 1965, Williams headed to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas for his internship. He returned to the University of Arkansas Medical Center for a four-year, internal-medicine residency while simultaneously doing a general surgery residency at Parkland. Then it was on to a two-year cardiovascular surgery fellowship at New York University Medical Center that he completed in 1973.  It just happened that he went into heart surgery, Williams says. \"I just kept moving toward things that seemed interesting to me.  \"[It] was fortuitous timing that we happened to come up with coronary bypass [surgery] when I was right toward the end of my general surgery residency,\" he recalls. \"The heart-surgery world changed once we got started doing coronaries because the number of people having surgery jumped up so much. ... The first medical report of coronary bypass surgery in any numbers, other than one case at a time, came out in 1968. So in 1971, I was doing heart surgery training at NYU, which was one of the few places in America that was teaching people to do coronary surgery. I think we might have known how to do it back then; it doesn't really seem like we knew too much. But of course, it was a brand-new field.\"  After the fellowship ended, Williams, as he puts it, \"got ready to go out into the world and make my living.\" He took a job at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, starting an open heart surgery program. \"It was a very good place for me to be, but they didn't have a cath lab, which means they couldn't turn out many heart surgery patients.\"  Deciding to return to Little Rock, he contacted the then-head of the surgery department at UAMS, a heart surgeon himself.  \"He sent me a nice letter that said, 'The last thing we need in Little Rock is a heart surgeon; we've got way too many already,'\" Williams recalls with a chuckle.  But return to Little Rock Williams did, and set about his pioneering work. During the years 1976-77, he restructured the open heart surgery program at then-Baptist Medical Center and started the open heart surgery program at what is now CHI St. Vincent Infirmary Medical Center. A decade later, he began the open heart surgery program at the former Doctors Hospital in Little Rock.  Williams attributes these accomplishments to his being in the right place at the right time. \"Somehow we got some programs going, and got real busy.\"  In 1997, 10 years after starting the open heart surgery program at Doctors, Williams went to Arkansas Heart Hospital and did the same thing.   SETTING THE STANDARD  Dr. Jerry M. Herron, retired from internal medicine and pulmonary critical care, remembers the days when there were only three cardiologists in town, let alone heart surgeons. Back then, patients went to Houston for heart surgery by Dr. Denton Cooley, the man who became famous for the first implantation of a totally artificial heart.  \"We really needed a cardiovascular surgeon here,\" says Herron, whose wife, Betty, is Symphony Guild chairwoman. He tells how, when the Little Rock cardiologists heard Williams was coming, one of them checked him out with Cooley ... who said that if Williams was coming to Arkansas, there'd be no more need to send patients to Texas.  \"And sure enough, he set the standard,\" Herron says of Williams. \"He's just a good bedside physician, a wonderful surgeon and a good medical doctor, too.\"  Dr. Kent C. Westbrook agrees. The distinguished professor of surgery in the department of surgery at UAMS has known Williams since the two competed against each other as high-school football quarterbacks ... Williams for Booneville High and Westbrook for Clarksville High.  \"When people have a difficult heart problem, they want to at least talk to [Williams], even if they can't get to be his patient,\" Westbrook says. \"The doctors in the state respect him enormously.\"  Murphy certainly does. When it came time for Murphy's own father to have heart surgery, he sent him to Williams. \"That was many years ago, and my dad's alive and well and doing just fine.\"  What does Williams consider to be the biggest triumph of his career? \"Every patient that does well is a triumph,\" he says. His biggest challenge has been getting older and seeing all his referring physicians retire. \"Young doctors like to work with young doctors. So my present challenge is, trying to figure out if I need to keep practicing,\" he says.  Since the early days of his career, Williams notes, heart surgery technology has become so much better.  \"When I was a medical student at UAMS, and a medical resident at UAMS, the word was, if you have a valvular disease and you go to heart surgery, your chance of dying was 100%. Now your chance of dying with those things is far less than 5%.\"   PAYING IT FORWARD  Williams has also worn a longtime hat as an educator, serving as director of a number of medical programs and divisions throughout the years. He's currently a lecturer and associate clinical professor of surgery at UAMS. Shaping young doctors has been important to Williams, and so has the work of others who help shape minds. Williams sponsors a mentor award, named after his childhood mentor, Inez Radford. The award, which carries a $1,000 prize, is given to an outstanding teacher in Booneville.  His own awards and accolades include being presented with the 2018 Dean's Distinguished Alumnus Award from the UAMS College of Medicine. \"I think he's one of the really great physicians that have come out of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in the last ... 60 years,\" Westbrook says.  When it comes to matters of the heart, it's not all medical with Williams. He has been married for 15 years to Leslie. The couple have seven children between them, five of which are his. Williams also has 10 grandchildren; the youngest lives in Little Rock and, he says, \"takes up a fair amount of our time.\"  \"We have another grandchild that lives in Dallas, that thinks just visiting us and driving our tractors is the best thing that ever happened to him. He just loves it. He's learned how to drive by driving a tractor with Grandpa,\" says Williams, who also has two great-grandchildren.  He looks forward to the time Symphony Designer House tour and event ticket holders, too, will also be able to visit and see Belle Maison in all its re-created glory.  \"We just hope it will be real successful because of all the effort that [we've seen] going into it.\"   SELF PORTRAIT   Dr. C.D. Williams  • DATE AND PLACE OF BIRTH: March 18, 1941, Fort Smith  • BEST ADVICE I'VE EVER RECEIVED: My grandfather wrote me a letter when I was 9 years old [and said] when you give a public speech, you should always refer to the Bible. That way, maybe people would think you'd actually read it. He had a sense of humor. Also, Joe Bates, who is a public health doctor in town, told me before I went off to Texas to do my surgery ... \"You need to come back to Arkansas to practice. The state of Arkansas has spent a lot of money on your education. And you owe it to them to come back.\"  • I WISH MY PATIENTS WOULD REALIZE: That health doesn't come out of a pill bottle and that they are really the ones responsible for their health. And if you don't take care of yourself, it doesn't make much difference what the doctor does. The outcome will not be very great. Now there are some people that know that really well, and there are some people that don't act like they understand that at all. But I'll see patients in my office day after day that are taking 20 different prescriptions. I don't even know how their body can function, much less be healthy. So I wish people would take better care of themselves.  • ADVICE I GIVE MEDICAL STUDENTS: Be real open-minded here and try to see a bigger picture than just a specific drug for a specific ailment because that'll be changing pretty soon. The new drugs will displace them. Many of the operations I did as a young doctor aren't even done anymore. Everything changes and you've got to be ready to change with it.  • FANTASY DINNER GUESTS: Dr. Rene Favaloro (of Argentina, the father of coronary surgery); Dr. Denton Cooley, (noted heart surgeon); Dr. George Reed (retired heart surgeon from New York, who taught me how to do technical surgery); Charles X. Williams (my grandfather); Inez Radford (childhood mentor); Dr. Bill Snyder (a lifelong friend and surgeon).  • MY GUILTY PLEASURE: Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. I wish I didn't eat a bunch of sugar, but it's really hard to stay away from those things -- especially if somebody throws one out in front of you. Leslie gave me one for Christmas that weighed a pound.  • ONE WORD TO SUM ME UP: Servant-leader.

Now his Salt Lake City-based preparedness company, Emergency Essentials, is riding a rise in people across the United States looking to buy stashes of items such as water filters, face masks and stores of food amid fears over how far the coronavirus outbreak could go.  “The coronavirus has definitely sparked a huge demand across the board for companies like ours,” Conlee said. “We suspect this will be a longer-term demand spike, as opposed to something like hurricanes,” when demand rises for just a few weeks.  The preparedness industry, which targets a contingent often called “preppers,” markets the goods and advice needed to survive anything from a tornado to a quarantine to a full-blown apocalypse.  There are different subsets within the community, said Conlee. He’s part of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, colloquially called Mormons, among whom a culture of emergency preparedness is common. But he said 90 percent of his customers now come from across the United States and range from anyone fearful of natural disasters to more apocalyptic doomsayers to Silicon Valley tech circles.  At the end of January, Conlee started seeing a rise in searches around coronavirus and an uptick in the scale and scope of purchases. Within days, the company’s supply of N95 masks ran out.  Jon Stoke, deputy editor of the Prepared, a website dedicated to the preparedness industry, said he’s also seen a surge in traffic to his site since late January. In early February, he put up a page specifically dedicated to tips for preparing for and surviving an outbreak.  There are only 15 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, and the vast majority of infections remain centered in certain parts of China. The World Health Organization has warned that shortages of protective gear like face masks is due to people stocking up, and has put health-care workers and those at the center of the outbreak at greater risk.  Despite the fact that the outbreak remains many miles and time zones away, Stoke, who lives in Texas, said he didn’t think those stocking up on emergency essentials were driven by panic.

Photo : Getty  For the last two weeks, youth climate organizers in New York have been discussing how climate striking may change now that the novel coronavirus had reached the state. These conversations have been happening elsewhere, too, including in Spain and Belgium. And now Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teen activist that galvanized the global climate strike movement, is calling on strikers around the world to stay home and strike digitally.   Advertisement  “We can’t solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis and we must unite behind experts and science” Thunberg tweeted on Wednesday, echoing one of her common refrains about climate science. “This of course goes for all crises. Now the experts urge us to avoid big public gatherings for a better chance to #flattenthecurve and slow the spreading of the [c]oronavirus.”  COVID-19, the formal name for the virus, has killed more than 4,300 people globally and infected more than 120,000. The World Health Organization has officially declared the virus a pandemic. The entire country of Italy is under quarantine as of Tuesday. That means no public gatherings, and everyone should stay home. Such measures make total sense in light of how rapidly the coronavirus is spreading, but they definitely make protesting tricky.   Advertisement  Last week, youth strikers with Fridays for Future had planned to attend international climate talks at the European Parliament in Brussels where Thunberg spoke. But the European Union informed them the day before that they could no longer attend due to increased security around COVID-19, Marta Bordons, a 22-year-old climate striker with Juventud Por El Clima in Spain, told Earther.  The rapidly shifting situation has propelled the youth movement built on large gatherings to start thinking of alternatives to in-person events. Shiv Soin, a 19-year-old lead organizer with the New York City Youth Climate Coalition and executive director of the local grassroots group TREEage, told Earther he and his peers haven’t yet decided to end their Friday climate strikes outright. But they may limit weekly participation to only a few people for now. If things worsen in New York, the coalition is prepared to shift strategies. Organizers are still developing contingency plans. Until that’s all sorted out, however, they’re encouraging digital strikes because their current priority is the health and safety of their communities.   Advertisement  “We’re trying to adapt to this situation because we humans have to adapt to the consequences we are facing the same way the government should adapt to the consequences of the climate crisis,” Bordons told Earther.  So what does this look like? It’s certainly not the thousands-strong street rallies we’ve seen over the past year. Instead, digital strikes will involve youth activists taking photos with a sign and posting them to social media with the hashtag #DigitalStrike.   Advertisement  That borrows a page from Fridays for Future Digital, which has existed as a social media campaign since November 2019 to support any young adults who are unable to skip school to strike in-person. Iris Zhan and George Zhang founded this page and effort last year because they, too, wanted to take part. However, missing school was not an option for them.  “We wanted to make the movement more accessible and easy to join,” Zhan told Earther.   Advertisement  Every week, the Twitter page posts a theme strikers can post around. Zhan hopes the movement gains more traction and gains further legitimacy among the broader climate strikers , especially after getting a shout out from Thunberg. Now, it certainly appears more individuals may be joining in digital protest.  Face-to-face planning meetings are also moving online. Many organizers already use Slack, WhatsApp, and other online tools to communicate given the strike movement is global. But the young strikers are still trying to figure out other creative ways they can continue their essential work without convening in large groups.   Advertisement  Their big challenge will come around Earth Day. Major global strikes were planned next month in coordination with Earth Day’s 50th anniversary. That may not be an option anymore if the coronavirus continues to hit cities around the world.  But youth activists will continue to push for real climate action despite the pandemic. Bordons, at least, wishes world leaders would treat the climate crisis with the same urgency they’re giving COVID-19.   Advertisement  “The coronavirus is spreading around the world and we have to be aware, but scientists have been for so long saying that we’re in a climate and ecological crisis, and no one has reacted the way they are reacting for the coronavirus,” Bordons said. “We should also think about that if they are both crises, why can we adapt to one and not to the other?”  Update 3:15 p.m. EST: This story has been updated with comment from Iris Zhan, a co-founder of Fridays for Future Digital.

This is how we support a resilient society. Additional support is available through the self-help groups and community development councils (CDCs)...  With this set of schemes, we balance between targeting our support for those who need it more, and flowing support quickly to large groups. It is not an easy balance, and we will do our best to calibrate this.  Some of our support has to be broad-based, so that we can flow the support to our people quickly. I encourage those who do not need the cash payouts to share it with those who need it more, by donating to Giving.sg or the Community Chest's Courage Fund, or to directly share it with others.  Mr Pritam Singh (Workers' Party MP for Aljunied GRC) noted that the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets have features of the New Deal in the US, and went on to ask if we can provide continued support beyond nine months, even after the pandemic subsides. He made a comparison to the New Deal, and asked if we should have a \"living wage\" for our essential services workers, including cleaners.  As Mr Singh himself pointed out, the \"New Deal took more than six years and secured the US as a welfare state with a strong federal government and a perennial national debt problem\". He went on to say \"the comparison with the New Deal is nonetheless thought-provoking\".  Indeed, we should think hard about this. While the New Deal was meant to bring the United States out of the Great Depression, its ideas have polarised American society. We still see this schism today - between liberals who support it for its comprehensive relief and reform programmes, and conservatives who oppose it for being hostile to business and growth.  The United Kingdom went through a similar phase, with its governments swinging between the left and right of the political spectrum. I was a student in the United Kingdom in the early 1980s, when Mrs Margaret Thatcher rode to electoral victory when ordinary Britons got fed up with the Winter of Discontent in 1978-1979 where there were widespread strikes in the public sector, including in the NHS (National Health Service).  It is important that in any policy-making, we pay attention to the subtle but significant changes in the tone of society, in the attitudes of people and in relationships which will take years to show, and which are not easy to reverse.  In making good public policy, we should be rigorous and clear-headed, and not rely on some ideological short cuts or labels, without thinking deeply about interactions and longer-term effects.  For our Little Red Dot, we must have the courage and wisdom to do what is right for us - and not rely on simple ideology or fad or fashion of the day.  For this Government, it has never been a question of whether we \"want to spend\". Rather, it is a question of \"how do we make the best use of resources, to achieve the best outcome for our people\".  If we stay adaptable, we can keep adjusting our social security system according to the needs of the day.  For example, the recent wave of digitalisation has brought great rewards to the innovators, but also put pressures on employment and wages for older workers. We have responded with social support schemes like the Workfare Income Supplement.  A store in Plaza Singapura closing on Monday ahead of the Covid-19 \"circuit breaker\" measures which kicked in yesterday. While Singapore engages in a whole of nation effort to battle the coronavirus outbreak, businesses also need to take the opportunity to transform now as the post-Covid-19 landscape will be vastly different, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in Parliament yesterday. ST PHOTO: GAVIN FOO  To help tide our people through immediate challenges in this crisis, we have been adaptable and introduced schemes like SIRS (Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme) and the Covid-19 Support Grant.   FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY  Let us commit to making sure that what we do is fiscally sustainable, not just in this term or next term of government, but for our future generations.  Our ability to put together a support package for Singaporeans amounting to 12 per cent of GDP, without borrowing against our future, is testament to the optimal fiscal balance we have sought to maintain over the years.  But the Government cannot do this alone. In the spirit of SG Together, I am glad that many are stepping up to help others.  The mayors and their five CDCs have stepped up local assistance schemes to support the heartlands, and partnering local merchants to do so. Our charities, IPCs (Institutions of a Public Character) and self-help groups have also come forward spontaneously to support Singaporeans in need.  The Community Foundation of Singapore has launched the Sayang Sayang Fund to boost the morale of front-line healthcare workers with transport vouchers and some cash support, and provide disadvantaged students with support for their meals. In just two months, the fund has raised $1.1 million from more than 1,500 donors.  Many Singaporeans have been helping one another, distributing hand sanitiser, masks and even meals to those who need them more. Some even offered their homes to Malaysian workers who were affected by the Movement Control Order. Singaporeans are also taking care of the seniors amongst us.  These are spontaneous acts of community support, and I hope they inspire more to do the same. This is the social cohesion and resilience that we must have.   OPPORTUNITY FOR BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION  Covid-19 will re-shape our world and amplify the global structural shifts already under way. With these shifts come risks as well as opportunities.  It will accelerate structural shifts in global supply chains. Global and regional businesses will place a higher premium on locations that offered stability, reliability and effective governance. Overall, trust will command a higher premium.  It has also accelerated digitalisation and adoption of technology in our daily lives. Many more firms, workers and consumers have had the opportunity to embrace new models of remote working, online learning, telemedicine and e-commerce. They will not automatically switch back to their previous habits.  We are in a good position to make the most of these opportunities in a post-Covid-19 world. To do so, we will redouble our efforts to position Singapore as a global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise. Even during this period, companies have continued to engage Singapore on new projects and the development of new capabilities.  Just last week, Hyundai announced its opening of an innovation lab in the Jurong Innovation District to develop and test technology across the automotive supply chain, and trial electric vehicle manufacturing. In the same week, ExxonMobil held a virtual foundation-laying ceremony to deploy new technology to upgrade its integrated refining and petrochemical complex.  We will also press on with our Smart Nation and R&D efforts. We will continue building smart towns like our Punggol Digital District, and our efforts in deploying autonomous vehicles.  Businesses need to take the opportunity to transform now, as the post-Covid-19 landscape will be vastly different. The question we should ask ourselves even now is when that day comes, what sort of world will it be, and how ready Singapore will be to march forward again.  We should think ahead, on how we can deepen economic and social resilience. In this spirit, we will set up two initiatives - an Emerging Stronger Taskforce on economic resilience and a new emphasis on social resilience under the Singapore Together movement.  The Emerging Stronger Taskforce under the ambit of the Future Economy Council is to help our economy bounce back from the crisis. Minister Desmond Lee and Mr Tan Chong Meng, Group CEO of PSA International, will co-chair this task force, to review how Singapore will stay economically resilient and build new sources of dynamism in a post-Covid-19 world.  The Singapore Together movement, led by Ministers Indranee Rajah and Desmond Lee, will mobilise Singaporeans to explore how we can deepen our social fabric and partnerships between government and people in Singapore, and between Singaporeans and people around the world.  This will be a whole of nation effort, which will take our collective energies and ideas to do well. We will have a series of national challenges across different domains to encourage ground-up participation.  One of the first challenges is the \"Singapore Together Stay Home for Singapore Challenge\". I am asking all of us to be a part of it. These four weeks of circuit breaking will feel unusual and unnatural. The challenge is to help ourselves and others stay home and do so purposefully and positively.  As we stay home, how might we thrive, by staying healthy and learning? How might we connect with our loved ones and community? How might we help others? How might we get help?  This will be a time for reflection, to learn something new, bond with loved ones, to show care and support for one another, and do something active and constructive for the community.   GOOD GOVERNANCE  We are entering uncharted waters in the fight against the Covid-19 outbreak, and we cannot predict with precision how long this will be. I presented the Unity Budget to this Chamber on Feb 18. Thirty-seven days later, on March 26, I presented the Resilience Budget. And 11 days later, yesterday, I presented our Solidarity Budget. Three Budgets, within just 48 days.  We are dedicating close to $60 billion, amounting to 12 per cent of our GDP, to deal decisively with the situation at hand. The three Budgets make up our largest Budget in any one financial year, in dollar amount and as a percentage of GDP. This is the largest spending in any financial year in our nation's history.  We also incurred the largest budget deficit ever - $44.3 billion, or 8.9 per cent of GDP. This deficit alone is half of our total spending in the preceding financial year.  We had to seek the President's approval to draw on our past reserves, not once, but twice. In total, the President has given her in-principle support for the Government to draw up to $21 billion from our past reserves for the Resilience Budget and the Solidarity Budget.  As Finance Minister, I am extremely grateful that we have been able to tap the deep financial reserves - our current and past reserves which have been so carefully built up, invested and managed. This has allowed us to respond to the crisis without having to borrow, and without burdening our future generations with repayment obligations.  But just exactly how deep are our reserves? Members would know that our reserves comprise assets invested by MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore), GIC and Temasek. MAS and Temasek publish the size of the funds they invest. It is the size of the funds invested by GIC that is not published. We do not disclose the total size of our reserves for the sake of our national security and strategic interests.  As a small country without any natural resources and highly dependent on imports, our reserves are vital to our overall economic and financial stability, and our well-being.  They provide a key defence for Singapore in times of crisis. During the 2008 global financial crisis, the late President S R Nathan approved the provision of $150 billion from our past reserves to guarantee bank deposits in Singapore. This move calmed our depositors, and we did not have a single bank run during that very difficult period. All our depositors' monies were safe. In 2009, President Nathan approved a draw of $4.9 billion from the past reserves to fund the Resilience Package then, to help us overcome the crisis.  Having our reserves therefore played a key role in helping us emerge stronger from that crisis. In fact, our economy rebounded quickly.  Our reserves serve as a strategic defence. They give us the wherewithal to resolutely defend the Singapore dollar against speculative attacks. This contributes to a stable Singapore dollar, which in turn bolsters the confidence of investors and citizens.  Our reserves are thus no different from SAF's (Singapore Armed Forces) arsenal. No country's armed forces will ever tell you exactly how much ammunition and weaponry they really have. To do so is to betray valuable intelligence to potential adversaries. This is obviously not a wise defence strategy, and likewise should not be adopted for our financial reserves.  What Members should focus on are the policies and programmes, especially those which may require the use of reserves. Debate the merits of these programmes, including the expenditure required for them. But let's be clear - it is neither in the interest of Singapore, or Singaporeans, to repeatedly ask about the size of our reserves.  We are in the middle of a storm, and I am very disappointed that Mr Pritam Singh has used this occasion to raise this question again.  Many have urged us, year after year, to spend more of our reserves to fund our growing expenditure, suggesting that we do not need to save so much or to ever raise taxes.  But we kept the discipline, and stuck to our principle of using the returns from our reserves in a prudent manner. We do not view the reserves as a piggy bank to be broken at will, to provide the Government with a convenient source of additional revenue. We avoided running deficits in good years, and consistently saved.  If we had succumbed to the political pressure to spend more of our reserves in good years, we would not have had the war chest to deal with critical moments, such as now. And to do even more, if necessary, even in the next term of government.  But the aftermath of the Covid-19 outbreak may be with us for a long time, and we will need to deal with it on a sustainable basis. If the crisis deepens, our economy and revenues will shrink, we may have to make use of our past reserves again for a recovery.  While we must make plans, and we are, at this hour, let us focus our minds fully on making the best use of this very unprecedented Budget, to build social and economic resilience.  And if there is a need, we have the institution of the Government and the Elected President to decide on how best to use our resources to manage a crisis.  So indeed, this crisis has re-affirmed the value of our key institutions and the key tenets of our prudent fiscal policy - to spend prudently, invest wisely, and plan consistently for the long term.   RESOURCEFUL, DISCIPLINED PEOPLE  Beyond our financial reserves, I am grateful that we have been able to tap the deep reservoirs of strength and resourcefulness of our people.  Without the strength, resourcefulness, trust of our people, all the right measures won't be worth the dollar tag on them. But, with these, our combined strength is worth so much more.  Our healthcare workers, Home Team officers, cleaners and many other unsung heroes have carried out their duties with commitment and courage.  They have had a very tough time. They have to stay alert and careful, while working long hours and weekends. It is very moving that our people recognise this and pour out strong support for them.  Many Singaporeans have made videos and written letters of appreciation to spur our front-line workers.  Students and staff from Yew Tee Primary School made personalised cards and a video to show support and appreciation for the front-line staff of various hospitals, and our police officers. And there are many others.  Indeed, our national stock of resilience is made up of all our individual stocks of resilience.  This has been an extremely hectic period for me, Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister Indranee Rajah, and all my Cabinet colleagues. I am grateful to my staff in MOF (Ministry of Finance), many of them young or with young families.  They have been working tirelessly for almost 10 weeks now - from Pongal, to Valentine's Day, to Chinese New Year, and over many weekends. It is the first time that MOF officers have had to prepare three Budgets within 48 days.  It is not only hectic. It has been emotional. We know what is at stake. Our lives, our livelihoods, our loved ones. Our home and nation. I know people like to call us at MOF bean counters, because we are always counting the costs and benefits of things.  We count, because you count.  We weigh up our reserves of strength, measure out the right actions to help our people and businesses, pace ourselves to go the distance, and save up for the future. We count, to protect our people and our home.  Indeed, as we draw down on our reserves to tackle this generational crisis of unprecedented scale, we must uphold our responsibility to steward our reserves properly in our time, for the benefit of our future generations.  Yesterday, Minister Khaw Boon Wan shared the story of his Primary 2 granddaughter who had been urging his wife and their helper to put on masks and to observe safe distancing.  And less than 24 hours ago, when I was here in this Chamber delivering the Solidarity Budget, a young mother was at home watching it live together with her daughter.  The mother later wrote to me saying that, afterwards, her daughter asked her: \"Will Singapore become bankrupt?\"  I was surprised and glad that her daughter and Minister Khaw's granddaughter could understand such values at such a young age.  As adults, let us uphold our values, and not let our children and future generations down. It is precisely for them that my team and I are determined to exercise fiscal discipline and prudence.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Related Story Interactive: How coronavirus is spreading across the world  The mother who wrote to me asked for an answer for her daughter. Will Singapore become bankrupt? No! We will never let Singapore become bankrupt.  The Spanish flu occurred in 1918, and Covid-19 in 2019. A hundred years from now, should there be another unprecedented crisis, will Singapore have the wherewithal to tackle it? It depends critically on the values of our people.  We have managed to weather this crisis so far because of our world-class healthcare system, our strong finances, our administrative capacity, our strong tripartite partnership and, most importantly, our exceptional people.  These were not built overnight. They require long-term planning, deliberate investment, stewardship of resources and careful build-up of capabilities.  This is only possible because of the values that this Government and our people have upheld across generations, which have allowed us to fight the crisis from a position of strength. These are the values of discipline, prudence and long-term thinking.  The journey ahead to the end of this crisis will likely still be long and uncertain. But my team and I will continue to stay vigilant and partner Singaporeans and people around the world. Difficult decisions will need to be made during this period, and we will do so with Singaporeans' interests at heart. We will get through this together.  Let us stand united, resilient and in solidarity. Singapore Together, Majulah Forever!

President Trump, in a short appearance during a White House press briefing, also said he supported U.S. restaurants and stores that have closed their doors in an effort to promote social distancing. Surgeon General Jerome Adams urged the public to follow that strategy — in many cases, not for individuals’ own sake but to protect older, sicker Americans.  “We need your help,” Adams said. “Social distancing and mitigation, they’re not to protect the 30-year-old or the 20-year-old from getting coronavirus. They’re to protect your nana, they’re to protect your granddaddy, they’re to protect the people you love in your lives.”   advertisement  Vice President Mike Pence urged Americans who are sick to stay home. He cited a bill that passed the House late Friday that reimburses small businesses — but not companies with 500 or more employees — for providing 14 days of emergency leave to employees sick with Covid-19, and for those caring for family members with the disease. The bill, which the Senate is expected to take up Monday, also expands unemployment insurance and food stamps for low-income families.  “You need not be concerned if you’re an hourly wage earner in America,” Pence said. “You need not be concerned about staying home. If you’re sick, stay home. You’re not going to miss a paycheck because of this legislation that’s moving through the Congress.”   advertisement  The president also said he had his temperature taken prior to the briefing, and that he had been tested for Covid-19, the respiratory disease that the coronavirus causes. The White House said it would begin temperature checks for all individuals scheduled to come into contact with Trump or Pence. Trump said results would likely come within one to two days. Pence said he and Second Lady Karen Pence would be willing to be tested as well.  The move comes after both Trump and Pence made contact with a Brazilian government official who later tested positive for the coronavirus. Physicians do not recommend testing for most Americans without Covid-19 symptoms, and the White House physician on Friday issued a statement arguing it was unnecessary from Trump to be tested.  Trump also justified repeatedly shaking the hands of private-sector executives during a Rose Garden press conference Friday, despite Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance discouraging handshakes.  Deborah Birx, the physician and longtime diplomat who the Trump administration brought on to coordinate its coronavirus response, issued a special warning to Americans who have lived with HIV/AIDS for decades and may still “carry a degree of immunocompromise.”  “Please take care of yourself,” she said. “Please ensure that you’re doing everything possible to ensure you don’t get exposed.”  While members of the task force, including Adams, Pence, and Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease researcher, emphasized social distancing and travel restrictions as valuable tools for combating the pandemic, Trump doled out plaudits — some self-directed — for his administration’s response.

Fauci, 79, is a renowned HIV doctor who has served as the nation’s infectious disease research chief since 1984, and was awarded the President Medal of Freedom in 2008.  Adams, however, took a uniquely sharp tone, telling the public he felt the need to speak hard truths as “America’s doctor.”  “If we are complacent, selfish, uninformed, if we spread fear and distrust and misinformation, this situation will last longer and more people will be hurt,” Adams said. “But if we pitch in and we share the facts, we will flatten the curve, and we will overcome this situation.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 13, "joy": 5, "negative": 5, "disgust": 5, "positive": 27, "anger": 6, "surprise": 9, "fear": 8, "trust": 4}, "metadata": ["washington", "trump", "united", "coronavirus", "distancing", "americans", "caring", "senate", "unemployment", "respiratory", "physicians", "repeatedly", "ensure", "infectious", "rebound", "pandemic", "institute", "hiv"]}, {"text": "CLOSE In hopes of limiting the spread of COVID-19, President Trump orders a suspension of all travel from Europe to the United States. USA TODAY  President Trump addressed the nation Wednesday at 9 p.m. EDT about his administration's response to the coronavirus.

Payroll taxes: He called on Congress to provide Americans with “immediate payroll tax relief,” and implored lawmakers to “consider this very strongly” despite bipartisan pushback that idea received Wednesday.  – Courtney Subramanian and John Fritze  Trump misspeaks on cargo ban, clarifies in tweet  Minutes after addressing the nation about the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump had to clean up his remarks Wednesday to clarify that he was not proposing a ban on cargo from Europe.  The president outlined strict travel restrictions on passengers arriving in the United States from hard-hit portions of Europe during his relatively brief Oval Office remarks. He then appeared to stumble over his words in a way that suggested those restrictions would also apply to cargo.  “And these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo but various other things as we get approval,” Trump told Americans. “Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing.”  But while the Trump administration has sought to limit European imports as part of his trade policy, cargo has never been on the table as a way to control the spread of coronavirus. Cargo from China continued, for instance, even as it became clear that the country was at the epicenter of the virus.  The White House quickly noted that the restrictions were focused on people, not boxes, and Trump later appeared to clarify his remarks in a tweet.  “The restriction stops people not goods,” Trump posted.  – John Fritze, David Jackson and Courtney Subramanian  Pelosi and Schumer urge Republicans to pass Democratic virus response bill  In a statement released following President Donald Trump's speech, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on Republicans to pass Democrats' legislation to blunt the economic effects of the virus and bolster the response to the virus.  The two Democratic leaders said the best response to the virus was \"for the president to focus on fighting the spread of the coronavirus itself,\" noting that Trump did not mention anything during his speech about the lack of coronavirus testing kits.  They asked Republicans to help pass Democrats' package to combat the virus, which would provide free coronavirus testing, paid emergency leave, food security, among other Democratic priorities. Democrats have said they saw a payroll tax cut like Trump had floated as a non-starter.   -Nicholas Wu  CLOSE A previous version of this video incorrectly stated how many people the 1918 Spanish influenza killed. USA TODAY  DHS to require U.S. passengers to undergo 'enhanced screening'  President Donald Trump's administration's said it was readying \"enhanced screening\" procedures for U.S. passengers returning from parts of Europe hard hit by the coronavirus.  The White House said the restrictions would closely match those imposed on people returning from China earlier this year.  In explaining the new restrictions, Trump said that the U.S. would be suspending travel from parts of Europe for 30 days. He said there would be exemptions for Americans who had \"undergone appropriate screenings. \"  The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement shortly after Trump's address, offering further clarity on the European travel restrictions the president discussed.  Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf said that the restrictions would \"deny entry to foreign nationals who have been in affected areas will keep Americans safe and save American lives.\"  Wolf said that DHS would issue a notice in the next 48 hours \"requiring U.S. passengers that have been\" traveling in parts of Europe to \"travel through select airports where the U.S. Government has implemented enhanced screening procedures.\"  – John Fritze and David Jackson  The 26 European countries hit with the travel ban  More than two dozen European countries are affected by the travel restrictions announced by President Donald Trump, according to the Department of Homeland Security.  The countries, known as the Schengen Area, include: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.  The president’s proclamation suspends the entry of most foreign nationals who have been in these European countries at any point during the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States.  The order does not apply to legal permanent residents, (generally) immediate family members of U.S. citizens, and other individuals who are identified in the proclamation, according to the agency.   – Ledge King  Minutes after speech, Donald Trump cancels Las Vegas trip  After President Donald Trump urged Americans to forgo unnecessary travel, the White House and the re-election campaign are canceling future events.  \"Out of an abundance of caution from the Coronavirus outbreak, the President has decided to cancel his upcoming events in Colorado and Nevada,\" White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said.  Trump had planned to address a Jewish Republican organization meeting in Las Vegas and to host a conservation roundtable in Denver.   – David Jackson  Trump asks for payroll tax relief despite GOP hesitance  During his Wednesday night speech, Trump asked that Congress consider payroll tax cuts – a request that lawmakers in both parties have voiced concern about.  \"I am calling on Congress to provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief,\" Trump said. \"Hopefully, they will consider this very strongly. We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus.\"  The idea has been met with skepticism in recent days from even Republicans, who call the idea both premature and something that would not help in this situation.  \"I would prefer they exercise other options before going down that path,\" Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, has said. Democrats have said the idea is something that would have no chance in passing the Democratic-held House.  \"It's a non-starter,\" Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, said earlier Wednesday of the payroll tax cut idea.   – Christal Hayes  Trump's speech faces a partisan response on the Hill  Democrats and an independent slammed Trump's speech after he concluded, while Republicans offered praise.  Rep. Andy Levin, D-Mich., whose state confirmed its first two cases of the coronavirus yesterday, tweeted, \"Mr. President, you can’t travel ban your way out of this.\" Rep. Justin Amash, I-Mich. who left the Republican Party last year, called it \"disturbing in so many ways\" on Twitter.  Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., praised Trump for taking \"bold and decisive action to prevent the spread of #coronavirus.\" Close Trump ally Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, hailed \"proactive and decisive\" action by Trump to combat the virus.  Former Ambassador to the United Nations under President Barack Obama, Susan Rice, simply tweeted: “OMG.”  Congressman Don Beyer, D-VA., who has self-quarantined after dining with someone who tested positive for the virus, tweeted, “We have a pandemic with over a thousand coronavirus cases in the United States and counting. We don't need walls and travel bans, we need TESTS.”  Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who has become a staunch Trump supporter on Capitol Hill, said, “Tonight’s Oval Office Address by @realDonaldTrump was a strong and clear message to all Americans to encourage unity and swift action as we confront and ultimately beat Coronavirus.”  The First Lady, Melania Trump, made a public comment on coronavirus after her husband’s address, saying, “Our great country is fighting hard against the #Coronavirus. This nation is strong & ready & we will overcome. Please take action to prevent further spread. Visit http://cdc.gov for updated health info & updates.”  – Nicholas Wu, Savannah Behrmann  Trump stops short of declaring a national emergency  President Donald Trump ran through several ideas he said could help slow the spread of the virus and right an economy flailing amid the coronavirus outbreak.  One idea he did not raise: Declaring a national emergency.  In the hours heading into the address, there was widespread speculation that Trump could rely on the Stafford Act to declare an emergency. Democrats demanded that action earlier Wednesday, saying it would free up more than $40 billion in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds for the nation’s response.  Throughout the address, Trump used the word “emergency” and said his administration would take urgent action, including on taxes, but he stopped short of the promising to execute the broader emergency declaration.   – John Fritze  Extending the tax filing deadline  Some taxpayers won’t have to file their taxes by April 15 as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to lessen the economic effects of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday.  He also called on Congress to provide Americans with “immediate payroll tax relief.”  “Hopefully, they will consider this very strongly,” he said.  Trump didn’t specify who would get a filing extension and for how long.  But Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told the House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday the extension is intended to help \"small and medium-sized businesses and hard-working individuals\" heavily impacted by the widespread virus.  Mnuchin said an extension could put billions of dollars into the economy by giving businesses and individuals more available cash.  “This action will provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy,” Trump said.  But the move may mean the government will have to increase borrowing in the short-term to pay its bills before all returns are filed.  The extension does not require congressional approval, according to the administration.  House Democrats have already told the IRS they’re concerned that people may need more time to file because IRS officials and tax preparers may not be as available to assist.  Individuals are typically required to pay taxes by April 15 or they face penalties and interest charges. The IRS also grants taxpayers the option to file for a six-month extension.   – Maureen Groppe   Trump wraps up  Trump wrapped up his remarks at 9:11 p.m. EDT, about 10 minutes after he began.  “The virus will not have a chance against us,” he said.  The president’s remarks largely focused on actions he had taken so far and was less specific on what he plans to do moving forward.  Trump said he would take “emergency” action to extend the April 15 tax deadline, though he did not say specifically how long that extension would last. He reiterated his desire for a payroll tax holiday, despite the frosty reception that idea received on Capitol Hill from members of both parties Wednesday.   – John Fritze  Trump vows emergency action on paid family sick leave  Trump encouraged those who are not feeling well to stay home, saying he wants to \"ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship.\"  He said he would be soon taking emergency action to provide financial relief for workers who are quarantined or caring for others due to coronavirus. He added he would be asking Congress to take legislative action to extend the relief. The president did not indicate whether it would have an expiration, include a mandate or require government funding.  Advocates for paid leave say it's critical to help contain the spread of the virus as well as providing a safety net for low-income workers who are forced to stay home sick or self-quarantine.  Paid family sick leave is a key priority among Democrats and is expected to top their list amid negotiations over an economic stimulus package. Senate Democrats proposed emergency unemployment insurance to replace lost wages from quarantine or the need to stay home with children whose schools close. They also proposed requiring employers to allow workers to accumulate seven days of paid sick leave, allowing them to stay home to prevent the spread of disease, and also 14 days of paid sick leave at the beginning of any public health emergency.  Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the labor committee, proposed that the Senate immediately consider legislation for paid sick leave. But she was blocked by a Republican objection.  Murray said employees such as restaurant workers, truck drivers and service industry workers shouldn’t face the choice of working while sick or losing their pay.  “This is not a choice we should be asking anyone to make in the United States of American in the 21st Century, but 32 million people in our country today – or about one out of every four private-sector workers – are faced with this impossible choice every time they get sick,” Murray said.  Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., who chairs the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, objected to fast-tracking the legislation. He acknowledged workers are struggling but said businesses are also struggling and that an expensive federal mandate wouldn’t help them.  “The idea of paid sick leave is a good idea,” Alexander said. “But if Washington, D.C., thinks it’s a good idea, Washington, D.C., should pay for it.”  – Courtney Subramanian, Christal Hayes, Nicholas Wu and Bart Jansen  President Trump restricts 'all travel' from EU to US starting Friday  Trump said the administration would restrict “all travel” to the U.S. from Europe, which is reeling from the epidemic, for the next 30 days. The United Kingdom will be exempt from the new limits, which Trump said will go into effect on Friday at midnight.  “These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground,” the president said of the European Union travel curbs.  Italy has been hit the hardest, with more than 12,000 confirmed infections and more than 800 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. France, Spain and Germany each have about 2,000 confirmed cases.  Trump said there would also be travel restrictions from Europe for Americans \"who have undergone appropriate screenings.\"  The administration has already restricted travel from China and Iran. Trump has repeatedly trumpeted his early move to limit travel from China, saying the decision saved lives. Experts say it likely slowed the arrival of the virus in the United States.   – Deirdre Shesgreen  Trump tries to project sense of calm  President Donald Trump started off his remarks by trying to give a sense of historical perspective, and a sense of calm.  “From the beginning of time, nations and people have face unforeseen challenges,” Trump said. “It only matters how you respond and we are responding with great speed and professionalism.”  “We are moving very quickly,” Trump added.  The president’s remarks on his response come as he himself has been under fire for repeatedly appearing to contradict public health officials in his own administration.  “Smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow,” he said.   – John Fritze  Trump’s address on coronavirus is underway  President Donald Trump has started his address to the nation from the Oval Office on the coronavirus outbreak at 9:01 p.m. EDT, just about on schedule.  \"Tonight I want to speak with you about our nation's unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak,\" Trump said, noting the pandemic designation from the World Health Organization earlier in the day.  It’s a critical speech for Trump’s presidency by any measure. Look for him to address the public health aspects of the pandemic, his administration’s response and the potential economic impact – all while he attempts to calm a jittery nation and leave a door open to working with Democrats on an economic stimulus.   – John Fritze  Pence calls Pelosi before Trump speech  Vice President Mike Pence and another member of the administration’s coronavirus task force called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about an hour before President Donald Trump was scheduled to speak to the nation.  Pence and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, spoke with Pelosi briefly about the emergency legislation the House has proposed to combat the coronavirus, Pelosi’s spokesman tweeted.  Ahead of the President’s address this evening, Speaker Pelosi took a call from Vice President Pence and Dr. Fauci at approximately 7:43 p.m. They spoke briefly about the forthcoming emergency House legislation and Administration efforts to combat #coronavirus. — Drew Hammill (@Drew_Hammill) March 12, 2020  Trump's address will come hours after the World Health Organization formally declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic as the global death toll rose above 4,300.  As Congress and the Trump administration negotiate an economic package to cope with the coronavirus, disagreements are emerging over whether to focus on tax relief or provide direct aid to people who lose income from illness or an economic downturn.  Congressional Democrats proposed free testing for the virus and enhanced paid sick leave, unemployment insurance and food assistance.   – Maureen Groppe  Trump's second formal address from the Oval Office  When President Donald Trump makes his prime-time address tonight amid a widening coronavirus that is now a pandemic, it will mark only his second formal Oval Office speech to the nation.  Trump's address will come hours after the World Health Organization formally declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic as the global death toll rose above 4,300. Confirmed cases in the U.S. crept past 1,000, according to Johns Hopkins.  Amid a budget fight last year that led to a five-week partial government shutdown, Trump used a January address to pressure Democrats to agree to his request for $5.7 billion for his long-promised border wall along the southern border as a condition to end the stand-off.  During that speech, he stopped short of declaring a national emergency but declared one a month later to redirect funds from other federal agencies to the Department of Homeland Security to go toward building about 80 miles of barriers in California, Arizona and New Mexico. The decision led to a legal battle that went all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in July that he could use the military funding to build a portion of his wall.  More: Trump demands border wall in speech; Democrats accuse him of sowing fear  Earlier this year Trump addressed the nation from the Grand Foyer of the White House hours after Iran rained more than a dozen rockets down on U.S. airbases in Iraq housing U.S. troops. He sought to calm fears of a potential war with Iran after escalations over the U.S. killing of Qasem Soleimani, one of Tehran's most powerful leaders.  Trump is expected to again try to quell fears as the rapid spread of coronavirus sparks panic across the country and rattles the stock markets.   – Courtney Subramanian   Trump's address timing explained  President Donald Trump chose a critical day to deliver his rare address to the nation, a potential inflection point both for the coronavirus and the nation's response to it.  And there's an enormous amount at stake for the president.  Trump's remarks come hours after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic. It's a loosely defined word, but to be labeled a pandemic a virus must have \"sustained transmission throughout the world,\" Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told USA TODAY last month.  More: Coronavirus has been declared a pandemic: What does that mean  The president's speech comes as the global death toll rose above 4,600 on Wednesday and confirmed cases in the U.S. crept past 1,200, according to Johns Hopkins.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) (Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta, AP)  His remarks also arrive at an exceptional moment in U.S. politics, as Trump seeks to get a grip on the virus and its economic ramifications in an election year. Top White House aides are negotiating with House Democrats over an economic stimulus that Trump has described as \"dramatic.\" Details of that proposal, so far, have been very much influx.  The virus – and Trump's sometimes wobbly response to it – is also increasingly factoring into the 2020 presidential race. Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders have cancelled large rallies because of the virus, and are raising it as an issue to question Trump's leadership. A Trump campaign aide, meanwhile, claimed Wednesday that Biden was canceling events as \"an excuse to get off the campaign trail.\"  More: Trump aide says Biden using coronavirus 'to get off the campaign trail'   – John Fritze  Trump announces rare public address to the nation for coronavirus  President Donald Trump will make a prime-time address from the Oval Office on Wednesday about coronavirus amid widening concerns over an outbreak that is now a pandemic.  Trump's address will come hours after the World Health Organization formally declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic as the global death toll rose above 4,300. Confirmed cases in the U.S. crept past 1,000, according to Johns Hopkins.  \"I’ll be making a statement later tonight,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.  Trump initially said that his remarks would \"probably\" take place 8 p.m. EDT. He later tweeted that he would be \"addressing the Nation this evening\" at 9 p.m. EDT.  Trump declined to say whether he would announce additional travel restrictions or a national emergency. He said there would be economic and health announcements during his statement.  The president last delivered an Oval Office address to the nation on Jan. 8, 2019 amid the government shutdown. He used the address to make his case for additional federal funding for border security, including his long-proposed wall.  I will be addressing the Nation this evening at 9:00 P.M. (Eastern) from the Oval Office. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 11, 2020  The Trump administration is scrambling to respond to the public health and economic fallout from the virus. Trump and Democrats are negotiating over what the president described as a \"dramatic\" stimulus.

The \"America's Got Talent\" judge posted a video of herself lying in bed Friday on her Instagram story to reveal she's been suffering with multiple respiratory symptoms, but hasn't been able to get testing for COVID-19.  Supermodel Heidi Klum has asked to be tested for COVID-19, but hasn't been successful. Amy Sussman / Getty Images  The 46-year-old supermodel said her symptoms included “a chill, feeling feverish, cough, runny nose.”  “I hope it’s just a cold. I would love to do the corona test, but there just isn’t one here,\" she said, adding, \"I’ve tried with two different doctors and I just can’t get one.”  Klum is taking time off from \"AGT\" to recover and to avoid putting the show's other cast and crew members at risk. \"I’m just not feeling good,\" she explained. \"So that’s why I’ve stayed home to not infect any other people.\"  She ended her message by urging fans to protect their health and the health of others. \"Stay safe, everyone.

NBC News medical contributor Dr. Natalie Azar revealed Thursday that she'd tried and failed to have one of her own patients tested for the virus. \"I just tried to get a patient tested an hour ago, and I couldn't in my outpatient office,'' Azar said on MSNBC. \"The only place that we're currently doing it is in the emergency department, and they don't have enough.  \"They said we can only do it if the patient is sick enough to require hospitalization, and I was dumbfounded,\" Azar elaborated.  Azar addressed the issue again Friday on TODAY, saying that \"possibly we will have some outpatient capacity hopefully by today and, fingers crossed, by next week.\"  Commercial testing facilities like LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics have begun conducting tests, but only if doctors swab patients and send it to them, according to Azar.  \"What's so frustrating about this is that literally I'm gathering information as I go, as opposed to having it all up and running,'' Azar said. \"It's not for lack of preparation on the hospitals' part, it's just we don't have the tests.\"  Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, addressed coronavirus testing during a House hearing Thursday, saying, \"The system is not really geared to what we need right now.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 8, "positive": 5, "negative": 2, "disgust": 4, "joy": 1, "anger": 5, "fear": 4, "trust": 3}, "metadata": ["respiratory", "getty", "symptoms", "corona", "urging", "nbc", "azar", "institute", "infectious", "coronavirus"]}, {"text": "In the wake of a leap in the number of confirmed cases over the past several days with a cluster of infections linked to a religious group in the southeastern city of Daegu and a hospital in its adjacent country of Cheongdo, the authorities checked all service personnel with a history of visiting the regions or having contact with patients, and they are currently isolating around 7,700 soldiers at their bases.

The moves by officials bent on protecting their citizens raised new questions about how to maintain supplies of food, medical equipment and other goods in coming weeks that will be critical to nations in lockdown.  Word of the border closings fanned growing fears in Europe, prompting widespread hoarding.  “There is enough for everybody,” German Agriculture Minister Julia Kloeckner said, castigating people for spreading panic by posting fake reports that supermarkets would be closing. “I'm certain we will weather this society-wide situation well, so long as we behave as a society.”  The moves come as caseloads in Spain and Italy - where more than 2,500 deaths now account for a third of world's total - continued to spiral. Worldwide, the number of cases topped 190,000.  In the U.S., retailers and food companies scrambled to ramp up production after two weeks of panic-purchasing by shoppers. Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, and supermarket chains like Wegman's, cut store hours to give workers time to restock shelves.  To help speed shipments, U.S. officials suspended rules Tuesday capping the road time of truckers who are hauling food or emergency medical supplies.  The shortages come despite the fact that much of the food Americans consume is produced domestically and does not need to be moved across borders. But that has done little to quell fears that have emptied stores of items ranging from garlic to paper towels.  “I don't think anyone has seen anything like this ... certainly not in this country,\" said Per Hong, an executive at the management consulting firm, Kearney.  In Britain, where officials had resisted stringent measures to curb the virus, new research on the virus prompted a dramatic escalation Tuesday. A study by Imperial College London estimated that the virus could kill 250,000 people in the United Kingdom and more than 1 million in the U.S., unless officials took action to stop its spread.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson told people to eliminate unnecessary contact with others, work from home where possible and avoid bars, restaurants, theaters and other venues. Schools remained opened for the time being. Some scientists, though, said the government should have taken action sooner.  The European Union also issued guidelines aimed at facilitating the flow of critical goods like food and medicine, while helping individual nations restrict non-essential travel in an effort to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus.  But on Tuesday it was chaos on many borders, with traffic backed up for dozens of kilometers (miles).  “We are all desperate, cold and sleepless here for a third day,\" said Janina Stukiene, who was stuck in Lithuania on the border with Poland with her husband and son. \"We just want to go home.”  The line of cars and trucks in Lithuania was some 60 kilometers (37 miles) long after Poland closed its border, while similar traffic jams could be seen on the borders with Germany and the Czech Republic.  Lithuania was sending military airplanes and special trains to Germany to help hundreds of its citizens stranded at the crossing points with Poland.  To try to help citizens from Estonia and Lithuania get home following closure of the Polish border, German police organized a convoy of vehicles to a ferry port on one of its Baltic Sea islands.  Estonia, meantime, commissioned a ferry large enough for 2,500 passengers to fetch Estonians and Latvians unable to transit Poland to return home from Germany.  French President Emmanuel Macron, who had a phone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and EU officials, called for \"intensifying European coordination and quickly taking effective and concerted action.\" He condemned unilateral border control measures by some member states within the EU, according to his office.  Like Germany, France insists the free flow of goods must be guaranteed and cross-border commuting for work should be allowed.  Germany launched a 50 million euro ($56 million) effort to bring home thousands stranded in popular winter vacation spots across the globe, including up to 5,000 in Morocco alone.  “Even if we will do everything humanly possible, we cannot in every case provide a solution within 24 hours,” Foreign Minister Heiko Maas warned.  More than 100,000 Germans are thought to be in various places around the world looking to get home, including some 30,000 in Egypt, primarily on holiday.

Sen Tom Begich, D-Anchorage, said in closing comments he was inclined not to vote for the bill as he felt it did not do enough to protect the integrity of the upcoming elections scheduled during a time of restricted movement. During the debate on the bill, Begich proposed several amendments that he said would strengthen Alaskans’ ability to vote in elections scheduled for this year.  Anchorage has municipal elections scheduled for April 7, and Begich’s amendments were aimed at making it easier for people to vote under the city’s “hunker down” mandate.  Votes for Begich’s amendments broke mostly along party lines, with Democratic senators voting with Begich and Republicans voting against. Sen. John Coghill, R-North Pole, said he didn’t fully disagree with Begich’s intent, but the Division of Elections was already taking steps to accomplish many of the things the Anchorage senator had suggested, such as working to recruit a younger workforce for polling places.  Juneau asked to hunker down as second case confirmed  Several amendments were added to the emergency funding bill, including a cost-of-living adjustment for teacher and public employee retirement programs, prohibiting the increase in licensing fees for medical professionals and allowing the chief medical officer to set special sanitation standards during the emergency declaration for certain retailers.  According to the Legislature’s uniform rules, a reconsideration vote must take place on the next legislative day and expires at the end of that day unless extended by a simple majority vote.  Also on Tuesday, the Senate passed a bill sponsored by Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage, which reversed rate increases at the Pioneer Homes enacted last year and extended the moratorium on issuing new school construction bonds another five years.  On Monday the Senate passed an operating budget bill for FY21 and included in it a $1,000 relief check to be paid out in the coming weeks. Sens. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, Natasha Von Imhof, R-Anchorage and Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, opposed that addition.  A vote to rescind that amendment failed Tuesday, but the bill was sent to a special joint Conference Committee which will negotiate the final version of the bill. Sens. Stedman, Von Imhof and Donny Olson, D-Golovin, will represent the Senate. Reps. Jennifer Johnston, R-Anchorage; Neal Foster, D-Nome; and Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla; will represent the House.

As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads across the U.S. – canceling major events, closing schools, upending the stock market and disrupting travel and normal life – Americans are taking precautions against the new coronavirus that causes the disease sickening and killing thousands worldwide.  The World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise the public be watchful for fever, dry cough and shortness of breath, symptoms that follow contraction of the new coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2.  From infection, it takes approximately five to 12 days for symptoms to appear. Here's a step-by-step look at what happens inside the body when it takes hold.   Coronavirus infection  According to the CDC, the virus can spread person-to-person within 6 feet through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.  It’s also possible for the virus to remain on a surface or object, be transferred by touch and enter the body through the mouth, nose or eyes.   !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\");  Dr. Martin S. Hirsch, senior physician in the Infectious Diseases Services at Massachusetts General Hospital, said there’s still a lot to learn but experts suspect the virus may act similarly to SARS-CoV from 13 years ago.  “It’s a respiratory virus and thus it enters through the respiratory tract, we think primarily through the nose,” he said. “But it might be able to get in through the eyes and mouth because that’s how other respiratory viruses behave.”  When the virus enters the body, it begins to attack.  Fever, cough and other COVID-19 symptoms  It can take two to 14 days for a person to develop symptoms after initial exposure to the virus, Hirsch said. The average is about five days.  Once inside the body, it begins infecting epithelial cells in the lining of the lung. A protein on the receptors of the virus can attach to a host cell's receptors and penetrate the cell. Inside the host cell, the virus begins to replicate until it kills the cell.  This first takes place in the upper respiratory tract, which includes the nose, mouth, larynx and bronchi.  The patient begins to experience mild version of symptoms: dry cough, shortness of breath, fever and headache and muscle pain and tiredness, comparable to the flu.   !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\");  Dr. Pragya Dhaubhadel and Dr. Amit Munshi Sharma, infectious disease specialists at Geisinger, say some patients have reported gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea, however it's relatively uncommon.  Symptoms become more severe once the infection starts making its way to the lower respiratory tract.   Pneumonia and autoimmune disease  The WHO reported last month about 80% of patients have a mild to moderate disease from infection. A case of \"mild\" COVID-19 includes a fever and cough more severe than the seasonal flu but does not require hospitalization.  Those milder cases are because the body’s immune response is able to contain the virus in the upper respiratory tract, Hirsch says. Younger patients have a more vigorous immune response compared to older patients.   !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\");  The 13.8% of severe cases and 6.1% critical cases are due to the virus trekking down the windpipe and entering the lower respiratory tract, where it seems to prefer growing.  “The lungs are the major target,” Hirsch said.  As the virus continues to replicate and journeys further down the windpipe and into the lung, it can cause more respiratory problems like bronchitis and pneumonia, according to Dr. Raphael Viscidi, infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins Medicine.   !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\");  Pneumonia is characterized by shortness of breath combined with a cough and affects tiny air sacs in the lungs, called alveoli, Viscidi said. The alveoli are where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged.  When pneumonia occurs, the thin layer of alveolar cells is damaged by the virus. The body reacts by sending immune cells to to the lung to fight it off.  \"And that results in the linings becoming thicker than normal,\" he said. \"As they thicken more and more, they essentially choke off the little air pocket, which is what you need to get the oxygen to your blood.\"   !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\");  “So it’s basically a war between the host response and the virus,” Hirsch said. “Depending who wins this war we have either good outcomes where patients recover or bad outcomes where they don’t.”  Restricting oxygen to the bloodstream deprives other major organs of oxygen including the liver, kidney and brain.  In a small number of severe cases that can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which requires a patient be placed on a ventilator to supply oxygen.  However, if too much of the lung is damaged and not enough oxygen is supplied to the rest of the body, respiratory failure could lead to organ failure and death.   !function(e,i,n,s){var t=\"InfogramEmbeds\",d=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(\"script\");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\");  Viscidi stresses that outcome is uncommon for the majority of patients infected with coronavirus. Those most at risk to severe developments are older than 70 and have weak immune responses. Others at risk include people with pulmonary abnormalities, chronic disease or compromised immune systems, such as cancer patients who have gone through chemotherapy treatment.  Viscidi urges to public to think of the coronavirus like the flu because it goes through the same process within the body. Many people contract the flu and recover with no complications.  \"People should remember that they're as healthy as they feel,\" he said. \"And shouldn't go around feeling as unhealthy as they fear.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 12, "positive": 19, "negative": 15, "sadness": 2, "disgust": 12, "joy": 1, "anger": 15, "surprise": 1, "fear": 16, "trust": 1}, "metadata": ["pandemic", "disrupting", "americans", "precautions", "coronavirus", "cough", "shortness", "symptoms", "infection", "virus", "respiratory", "droplets", "infectious", "diseases", "massachusetts", "sars-cov", "enters", "fever", "pneumonia", "seasonal", "johns", "hopkins", "lung", "outcomes", "acute", "distress", "chronic", "cancer"]}, {"text": "Despite disapproval from some Nigerians and health workers’ groups, Chinese medical equipment and personnel have arrived the country to assist the government tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.

She sat in her office in Stamford and I was at home, on my laptop. She made sure I was stable and asked how I would ideally like to spend the postcard-perfect, early spring day.  Nothing odd there. Mental health professionals for years have treated patients remotely, either by phone or, more recently, using any number of video apps.  Ours was a simulated session to demonstrate a point. This type of treatment, whether for mental health or for many physical medical issues, can happen easily and efficiently. State law allows it and many insurance companies pay for video doctor visits like the one we recreated.  Here’s who doesn’t reimburse for live, remote visits: Connecticut’s Medicaid system, known generally as HUSKY Health. Any HUSKY patient who needs treatment, whether for mental health or any other medical service, needs to trudge to a doctor’s office.  That’s a population of 800,000 people who often don’t have a way to get there, and can’t take half a day off from work. And poverty tends to afflict them with more than the typical bevy of ailments, as poverty does.  The rule should have changed in 2015 when the state allowed tele-medicine. It should have changed in the years since, when Armah’s colleagues at CHC — by far the largest primary-care provider for low-income Connecticut residents on Medicaid — pleaded, cajoled and lobbied the state Department of Social Services to do so.  Now we have the COVID-19 coronavirus forcing vast swaths of society to remain isolated. Suddenly it not only makes sense for DSS to loosen its restriction — it would be dangerous if it didn’t happen.  And so we’re finally seeing some movement, with a hastily arranged meeting set for Tuesday — probably remotely, by video, of all ironies.  Crises will do that, but it shouldn’t have come to this. Most other states are way ahead of Connecticut when it comes to tele-medicine.  “I have argued from a humanitarian standpoint, we have a technology we should use,” said Mark Masselli, founder and CEO of the 48-year-old Community Health Center, which has 17 full-service clinics in Connecticut cities and 210 locations, many in schools and homeless shelters.   Better than in-person?  Arguments against Medicaid reimbursement have been somewhat murky. Perhaps it would lead to a flood of new patient visits that would cost taxpayers many millions of dollars — as if treatment for poor people isn’t good for all of us. Perhaps it would lead to an influx of low-quality charlatans, as if there’s a crush of doctors eager to treat the poor.  I thought the argument might be about quality. How could a remote session, whether with a psychiatrist or an internist, work as well as a good-old, in-person visit?  In fact, in some cases at least, Armah — who teaches at Yale School of Medicine and did her residency there, and heads behavioral health for CHC — said remote visits can be preferable. They keep patients at ease and the docs can see their surroundings.  “Some of our patients, because of the neighborhoods they live in, they don’t really come out of their homes,” she said And if they’re suffering from depression, “They don’t really get out of their beds to wash their faces and brush their teeth.”  And they miss appointments they would make remotely. On Monday, after coronavirus hit Connecticut, some patients didn’t show up in Stamford.  Meredith Johnson, the CHC chief of staff, came to the health center from Yale New Haven Health System, where she set up the tele-medicine system. Protocols for remote treatment are far along in the industry, she said. “We can’t reach through the camera and feel your glands,” she said, but for many issues, it’s no problem.  CHC has been testing tele-medicine for mental health for months now. I saw how efficient it can be, as they sent me a disclosure and approval form, then a link with help in setting up a Zoom account if I needed it, then a phone call to make sure I was ready for the lunchtime appointment.  “If DSS allowed us to be able to bill tele-health like they have in other states, we should be able to bill the full spectrum of patients,” Johnson said.   ‘You’re not alone’  It took a public health crisis to make it happen, if it does happen in the coming days and weeks.  “I think COVID-19 is to urban areas what the rural need was for rural areas 10 to 15 years ago,” Johnson said, referring to the rise of tele-medicine in places like Wyoming and Montana.  Connecticut? Here’s a line from a recent blog post at eVisit, a company that offers remote medical treatment technology: “Almost all states (except Connecticut and Rhode Island) have some form of coverage for live telemedicine within their Medicaid programs.”  “This is a tipping point,” Johnson said. “If we’re not going to approve tele-health now, when would we approve it?”  In my “session” with Armah, I told her I felt isolated, living alone with my child grown and gone, working at home most days. She showed how she can delve quickly into my psyche. “You’re not alone,” she said.  Even as one of the fortunate healthy people, with access to medical care and transportation, I could see how her words, her face, her treatment, could be a lifeline. That’s all the more true for the thousands of students in Community Health Center care, who may soon be homebound in the coronavirus crisis.  And if HUSKY qualifies for reimbursement, doctors treating many privately insured patients may get online more readily, and perhaps accept more Medicaid patients. “My whole purpose in life is to improve access to mental health care,” said Armah, who’s from The Bronx.  State ‘actively working on changes’  On Friday, the 18 federally qualified community health centers across the state, of which CHC is the largest, sent a letter to Dr. Deidre S. Gifford, a medical doctor who’s Gov. Ned Lamont’s social services commissioner.  “COVID-19 presents yet another significant challenge to our patients, including potential quarantines and other public health measures that may restrict movement and access to health care facilities throughout our state,” the letter said. “For patients with anxiety and other medical and behavioral health issues, the consequences of isolation and lack of access to their providers can lead to very negative consequences.”  About an hour after I sent an email to DSS asking about the issue, CHC received an invitation to a meeting Tuesday. The department isn’t saying it will immediately approve billing for HUSKY patients.  “We understand the importance and are actively working on policy changes in response to the COVID-19 issue, as well as for routine use in Medicaid/HUSKY Health under certain circumstances,” DSS spokesman David Dearborn said in an email.  It’s a challenge, with federal rules and technology and privacy concerns. But with Connecticut late to the party, it ought to happen fast.  “And here we are in a crisis,” said Masselli, the CEO, “where unfortunately even if they say ‘Okay, go ahead,’ many people won’t be ready because the department did not give them ample time to prepare.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 31, "positive": 33, "negative": 5, "disgust": 1, "joy": 4, "anger": 10, "surprise": 1, "fear": 4, "trust": 6}, "metadata": ["professionals", "medicaid", "connecticut", "coronavirus", "forcing", "crises", "humanitarian", "ceo", "homeless", "arguments", "in-person", "behavioral", "beds", "protocols", "crisis", "wyoming", "telemedicine", "students", "treating", "online", "isolation", "providers", "actively", "spokesman"]}, {"text": "UPDATE: we will be discontinuing grocery deliveries for the foreseeable future.Mutual Aid Katarokwi-Kingston formed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, when nearly everything was locked down, most of us were stuck at home, and many--especially those of us with compromised immunity and disabilities--were unsure if it was safe to go out.

Jerry Falwell Jr. for example, is defying the Virginia Governor’s recommendation to close Liberty University, and suggested, “the hype in the press surrounding the coronavirus pandemic could be a politically motivated attack against President Donald Trump.” https://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/falwell-liberty-university-will-resume-in-person-classes-after-spring/article_5bc5eed6-8c50-5973-bd09-4b2fb90a94b5.html Liberty students are now circulating a petition to have Falwell reverse his decision.  America has been flying blind since mid-January with a massive testing failure that should never have happened. The lack of testing has created confusion, and doubt on a grand scale that allowed the virus to spread mostly undetected. Trump’s nationalism in a globalized world is out of step with reality. On January 11th, Chinese scientists did the right thing when they posted the genome of the Covid-19 virus. Within a week, German virologists produced the first diagnostic test, and others soon followed. By the end of February, the World Health Organization had shipped tests to nearly 60 countries. Still, the Trump administration inexplicably rejected this generous offer. https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/06/coronavirus-testing-failure-123166  In a tweet, Trump blamed Obama and CDC for these failures. Trump had three years to do the right thing. Instead, he cut CDC’s budget, shut down the international pandemic response team, fractured relationships with our allies, and he froze CDC’s hiring. Unbelievably, Trump is still asking Congress to cut the CDC’s budget in his pending budget proposal. The Attorney General’s office is in court attempting to kill the Affordable Health Care Act, stripping vital insurance from millions and ending protections against preexisting conditions, etc. Donald Verrilli, a lawyer for the Democratic-led House, is challenging Trump’s efforts. He said in a filing before the Supreme Court that the Affordable Care Act is a “fixture of the American health-care system.” He urged the justices to review the “remarkable” lower court decision that “threatens profound destabilization of the health care system.” https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/03/politics/texas-republicans-trump-obamacare-supreme-court/index.html  While he attacks, ignores, and profoundly contradicts Federal scientists, Trump fires those who dare to speak the truth, and he suppresses verifiable facts from critical agencies. Trump has long denied the science of climate change. He has been systematically hollowing out critical Federal agencies and functions, including at EPA, the Bureau of Land Management, and the CDC, that provide sound science and hard evidence that contradicts his narcissistic prism and bad decisions. Heck, on his first day on the job, he played the “who are you going to believe your President, or your lying eyes?” with his inauguration crowd size. While this lie was not dangerous, it was a clear warning of Trump’s alternative universe.  Rebecca Boehm speaking for the Union of Concerned Scientists, “Moving these researchers out of Washington puts them out of earshot from policymakers. A lot of the research that scientists and economists do has policy implications, and members of Congress need this information and need to have face-to-face meetings with these researchers.” When the National Institute of Food and Agriculture scientists and economists warned of growing climate impacts on our food production, Trump retaliated by transferring them from Washington DC to Kansas City, driving out about 70 percent of the employees who refused to move.Rebecca Boehm speaking for the Union of Concerned Scientists, “Moving these researchers out of Washington puts them out of earshot from policymakers. A lot of the research that scientists and economists do has policy implications, and members of Congress need this information and need to have face-to-face meetings with these researchers.” https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453193-scientists-flee-usda-as-research-agencies-move-to-kansas-city-area  Trump hollowed out the State Department because (deep state) diplomatic experts contradicted his Putin-centered view of the world. Secretary Tillerson froze most hiring and offered a $25,000 buyout to push out nearly 2,000 career diplomats and civil servants. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/24/us/politics/state-department-tillerson.html  Unlike Truman’s “The buck stops here” desk reminder, on the COVID-19 testing failure, Trump claimed, “I don’t take responsibility at all.” Consider just a few of a sobering string of Trump’s misstatements and falsehoods.  From January 22 to date, here are only a few of his claims in chronological order, “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. It’s going to be just fine,” In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine. The 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero. We’re going very substantially down, not up. One day, it’s like a miracle; it will disappear.”  “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.” A day later, “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”  “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful; the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”  “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it. Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”  “I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.” “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine-tuned plan at the White House for our attack on Coronavirus.”  “This blindsided the world. “It goes away; it’s going away. We want it to go away with very, very few deaths.” “Biggest stock market rise in history yesterday.”  Trump’s bewildering word salad of lies counter the sound messages that health professionals have been offering. He and Pence have both been anti-science, and we are learning the hard way that we need to rely on science more than ever. Long before Trump’s presidency, far too many conservatives were challenging science over the teaching of evolution and they embraced the disinformation about climate change.  Perhaps this debacle will be a potent reminder of why we must once again embrace science over politics. According to Dr. Julie Snow, Professor, Department of Geography, Geology, and the Environment at Slippery Rock University, “During a time of uncertainty, leaders and advisors need to make decisions based on science. The scientific process was developed to produce accurate results with a known range of outcomes; it provides the best possible information to produce the best possible decisions. Trusting other sources of information impedes decision making and sends leaders and advisors down potentially dangerous roads.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 20, "positive": 25, "negative": 8, "disgust": 5, "joy": 3, "anger": 13, "surprise": 12, "fear": 15, "trust": 5}, "metadata": ["gatherings", "pandemic", "trump", "calling", "coronavirus", "americans", "virginia", "donald", "students", "circulating", "america", "virus", "scientists", "diagnostic", "cdc", "climate", "researchers", "washington", "institute", "impacts", "transferring", "2,000", "sobering", "professionals", "teaching", "reminder", "scientific", "trusting", "potentially"]}, {"text": "Several Florida sheriff’s deputies busted some suds and a few dance moves for good measure in the public service announcement, which stressed the importance of hand washing to combat COVID-19.  Coronavirus has people across the nation obsessed with keeping their hands germ-free.  Flagler County Sheriff’s Office joined the fray Friday, releasing a bubbly prevention video lathered in safety tips.  Several sheriff’s deputies busted some suds and a few dance moves for good measure in the public service announcement, which stressed the importance of hand washing to combat COVID-19.  Related: Coronavirus in Florida: Running list of what has been canceled or rescheduled because of COVID-19 concerns  The 90-second PSA features Flagler Sheriff Rick Staly and a bopping ensemble of uniformed deputies dancing in front of a bathroom sink cleaning up their hands with soap and water as a catchy hand-washing jingle plays.  The upbeat song accompanying the video is an original tune written, recorded and sung by Sheriff’s Office public affairs officer Shannon Martin. It implores washing hands for at least 20 seconds to avoid spreading infectious diseases, not forgetting to dig between your fingers, scrub your wrists and clean your thumbs. The lyrics include lines like, “Find yourself some water and get some soap. Lather up your hands and you’ll be good to go.”  One of the department’s drug-sniffing bloodhounds even gets in on the hand-washing party at one point.  “I love music and I have been paying guitar/singing since I was a kid,” said Martin, who appears in the PSA. “The Coronavirus has a lot of people scared and spreading a lot of information, some of it entirely untrue. So when the sheriff asked our public relations department to come up with some messaging, I thought that if we could come up with a fun way to get people to remember to wash their hands it would be a win-win. Remember, wash your hands!”  Read more: Florida ports brace for possible coronavirus disruption of business  An agency news release states the impetus behind the video was calls from several residents wondering how to properly protect themselves from the Coronavirus.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Prevention and Control recommends that people regularly wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. The CDC also advises people to avoid touching their faces and use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water aren’t readily available.

A few more were skinning up the Little Nell run. None were in line to get on the gondola, which wasn’t running after Gov. Jared Polis ordered the state’s downhill ski areas to close the night before.  “The governor decided he didn’t feel it was appropriate for us to continue to operate,” Mike Kaplan, Aspen Skiing Co. president and CEO, said Sunday morning. “We received final confirmation at 6:32 p.m. last night.”  The executive order issued by Gov. Polis directed Colorado ski resorts to close for one week “due to the presence of (COVID-19) in mountain communities with limited care capacity.”  Kaplan stood with a small group of Skico staff at the top of the stairs to the Silver Queen Gondola, talking with people who may have questions about the closure and how long it would be in place.  Though the lifts may be done spinning for the 2019-20 ski season, there’s still skiable snow on the mountains and some temperate spring skiing weather to come. The public health calls for social distancing and avoiding groups of people in recent days also have included encouragement to go outside and to exercise in order to stay active. Aspen is certainly good at that.  As public spaces closed and events and workplaces went virtual in the first days of the local outbreak and widespread social distancing, the mountains filled with uphillers and local trails also were packed with hikers.  Uphilling on Ajax, Snowmass, Buttermilk or Aspen Highlands is open and encouraged. Kaplan noted in a March 16 virtual community meeting that Skico would continue to do some very basic maintenance on the mountains to keep uphilling egresses and such optimal.  “From personal experience, I’d recommend you don’t go too early — it’ll be too icy,” Kaplan said. “And don’t go too late, because it’ll be too slushy. … Getting out and getting some exercise is important for all of us.”  Kaplan also encouraged skiers to be cautious, lest they require medical personnel on the mountain during this public health emergency.  To contain the spread of the new coronavirus, you must observe “social distancing” etiquette while hiking and skiing — stay at least 6 feet away from any of your outdoor partners and others.

That means far fewer customers for restaurants, shops and other businesses.  The Seattle area is dealing with the worst COVID-19 outbreak in the country, with at least 24 deaths, and businesses are bracing for the cascading effect of losing customers for the foreseeable future. Hotel bookings dropped as big conventions, including the Emerald City Comic Con, were canceled or postponed.  'You can see it and feel it on the streets. You can see it in restaurants and hotel lobbies,\" said Jon Scholes, president and CEO of the Downtown Seattle Association.  Scholes said the downtown street outside his window was nearly completely empty late last week. He watched a normally crowded bus drive by with almost no passengers.  The Whole Foods Market in the heart of Amazon's Seattle campus also was barely filled with customers Monday morning, when lines of shoppers usually crowd checkout lines.  In addition to Amazon, other employers have told people to telecommute. Amazon, however, has said it will keep paying the hourly workers who staff many food, cleaning and other services on its campuses even while they are largely empty. The tech giant has become the poster child of rising rents and increasing income inequality in Seattle \" but Amazon's tens of thousands of employees also make up a huge portion of customers for small shops and restaurants who rely on their business to stay afloat.  In Seattle's famed Pike Place Market, foot traffic has slowed enough that sales have dropped about 30% from last year's numbers at popular breakfast and lunch spot Bacco Cafe, owner Heong Park said.  Park's two restaurants in the market \" Bacco and Chan \" are hurting. But Park is optimistic people will start emerging from their homes after getting over the initial shock of the virus spreading in their community.  At his third restaurant, Meet Korean BBQ, in Seattle's nearby Capitol Hill neighborhood, the after-work rush has slowed, but people are still coming for later dinners.  Much of the concern is for businesses that operate in the massive shadow of Amazon's corporate headquarters. The company says it will help cover one month's rent for small businesses in its buildings and announced Tuesday that it would set up a $5 million relief fund for restaurants and shops near its South Lake Union headquarters. The fund will give small businesses cash grants to help make up lost revenue and pay employees as Amazon workers stay home.  The long lunchtime line has evaporated at Tacos El Tajin, a bright green taco truck that parks on weekdays in the heart of Amazon's headquarters. Owner Tomas Lopez said business has dropped around 75% in recent days.  'We're going to have to go find another location for now and wait for all the big companies to come back to work,' he said. 'Maybe a construction site or something like that.'  Without Amazon customers, some businesses might be forced to shut down if they don't get relief, said University of Washington marketing professor Jeff Shulman, who has studied the effect of Amazon on the city's economy.  'Rent is still due, insurance is still due, it's really expensive to operate a space in downtown, and you'd have to anticipate the revenues are not going to be there,' he said.  And if restaurants and stores are forced to close \" even temporarily \" it means many hourly workers will not get paid and could struggle to afford rent and other necessities in the increasingly expensive city, Shulman said.  'If the money is not there, it could be really problematic on people already struggling,' he said.  Hotels are seeing a 30% to 40% drop in occupancy, said tourism organization Visit Seattle, and cultural attractions and events are reporting 'steep declines.'  A coalition of businesses and other groups, including Microsoft, Amazon, Starbucks and the city of Seattle, created a fund to benefit economically vulnerable groups. It has $2.5 million in donations, largely from Amazon and Microsoft, and will give grants to groups that work with gig workers, health care workers, communities of color, people without access to paid health care and others.  Business groups are trying to get temporary relief for businesses and employees before the situation gets more dire.  The Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, Downtown Seattle Association and other organizations sent a letter to Gov. Jay Inslee and state lawmakers last week asking for the government to explore expanding unemployment insurance to cover part-time workers and set up an emergency fund to help small businesses.  Inslee announced new rules Tuesday that would allow workers to receive unemployment benefits if an employer needs to temporarily reduce or shut down operations because a worker is sick with COVID-19 and others need to be isolated or quarantined. A worker who falls seriously ill and has to quit also can now qualify for paid medical leave.  Inslee said he has directed state agencies to expand options for employees affected by COVID-19 to telecommute and for those who have to self-quarantine but can't work from home to be eligible for up to 14 days of pay.  'The suite of these policies are really going to help people weather this economically,' the governor said.   ___  Lerman reported from San Francisco.

Today's results come after the Humboldt County Public Health Laboratory processed 30 additional tests and outside laboratories processed another 19, for a total of 49.The county has reported 52 COVID-19 cases to date, with the majority — 28 — coming in a six-day period from March 30 to April 6. But the rate of positive tests has tapered sharply over the past week, with a combined five announced for April 5 and April 6, one April 7 and no others until sole positive tests yesterday and today. Yesterday, a Journal analysis of the limited testing data available found that the stretch of six consecutive days without a positive test coincided with a significant drop-off in samples tested at corporate laboratories.Humboldt County Public Health Officer Teresa Frankovich said she continues to expect to see more positive cases locally and that testing capacity remains an issue.“We are continuing to focus on getting all of the pieces in place as identified by the governor’s recent address , such as testing capacity and all aspects of preparedness,\" she said in the press release.To date, Humboldt County has tested a little more than 1 percent of the local population, a bit ahead of the national rate and about twice the testing rate statewide. Nationwide, more than 670,000 cases have been confirmed with more than 34,000 deaths, including 24,400 cases in California and 821 deaths.Frankovich and Humboldt County Sheriff William Honsal have repeatedly stressed the importance of local residents respecting the letter and spirit of the county's shelter-in-place order , staying in their homes and limiting essential outings, practicing social distancing measures and wearing facial coverings when they do have to leave home. The hope, Frankovich explains, is that these measures will slow Humboldt County's infection rate to the point that the number of active cases at any time — and the number of critically ill patients — does not overrun the local healthcare system, which has very limited capacity The California Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control, state that symptoms of novel coronavirus include fever, cough, runny nose and shortness of breath.needing immediate medical attention include difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to awaken, and bluish lips or face.Call ahead to the emergency room or inform the 911 operator of the possibility of a COVID-19 infection and, if possible, put on a face mask.

The Pasig City mayor is a nephew of the Senate President.  “If a local official has not violated any law, the DILG (Department of Local and Interior Government) is the (department) that has jurisdiction over him. Not the DOJ!” Sotto said in his Twitter post on Thursday.

To recall, the Pasig mayor initially allowed tricycles to ferry passengers, especially health workers, to their destinations as mass transport services were ordered suspended during the quarantine period.  However, the Pasig mayor already complied with the order to stop the operation of tricycles on March 20, or four days before the Bayanihan act was signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte.  “DOJ under ang NBI, if there is no law violated bakit mo papatawag ang mayor (why would you summon the mayor) ?

I don't know for sure.\"  He and his colleagues are doing their best to find out. Already, using another contraption that looks like a fancy dustbuster, they've sucked up air samples from 11 isolation rooms that housed 13 people who tested positive for COVID-19 infection, all of whom had a variety of mild symptoms.  In those air samples, researchers found the genetic fingerprint of the virus. \"It was more than half of the samples that we took. It was fairly ubiquitous,\" says Santarpia, \"but the concentrations were really pretty low.\"  Finding the genetic material doesn't necessarily mean that there's viable virus that could potentially make someone sick, he cautions. Some preliminary evidence indicates that this might be the case, but the team wants to do more work \"and try and be as certain as we possibly can whether or not certain samples had infectious virus in them or not.\"  They want to know that with a high degree of confidence because the question of whether or not the coronavirus can be \"airborne\" is extremely contentious right now — and it's a question that has real implications for what people should do to avoid getting infected.   Investigating 'Bioaerosols'  Now, citing Santarpia's results along with other studies, a committee of independent experts convened by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has weighed in, in response to a question from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy about whether the virus \"could be spread by conversation in addition to sneeze/cough-induced droplets.\"  \"Currently available research supports the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could be spread via bioaerosols generated directly by patients' exhalation,\" says a letter from the committee chair. By bioaerosols, they are referring to fine particles emitted when someone breathes that can be suspended in the air rather than larger droplets produced through coughs and sneezes.  Even if additional research shows that any virus in such tiny particles is viable, researchers still won't how much of it would need to be inhaled to make someone sick. But the committee experts also caution that uncertainty about all this is almost a given—because there's currently no respiratory virus for which we know the exact proportion of infections that come from breathing the virus in versus coming into contact with droplets in the air or on surfaces.  \"I personally think that transmission by inhalation of virus in the air is happening,\" says , an aerosol scientist at Virginia Tech. But she says so far, health experts have largely discounted the possibility of transmitting this coronavirus in this way.  \"I think the public is concerned about this, but the World Health Organization says 'no, the disease is not airborne,'\" says Marr.  \"From an infection prevention perspective, these things are not 100% black and white. The reason why we say 'droplet' versus 'airborne' versus 'contact' is to give overall guidance on how to manage patients who are expected to be infectious with a specific pathogen,\" said Dr. Hanan Balkhy, assistant director-general for antimicrobial resistance at WHO, in an interview with NPR earlier this week.  As an expert who worked to contain an outbreak of the deadly MERS coronavirus in Saudi Arabia, she believes that this new virus should behave similarly to other severe coronaviruses — and that means, unless health-care workers are doing invasive procedures like putting in breathing tubes, the virus is expected to primarily spread through droplets.  Droplets are larger respiratory particles that are 5 to 10 micrometers in size. Those are considered \"big,\" even though a 5 micrometer particle would still be invisible to the naked eye. Traditionally, those droplets are thought to not travel more than about three feet or so after exhalation. That would mean the virus can only spread to people who get close to an infected person or who touch surfaces or objects that might have become contaminated by these droplets. This is why public health messages urge people to wash their hands and stand at least 6 feet away from other people.  An \"airborne\" virus, in contrast, has long been considered to be a virus that spreads in exhaled particles that are tiny enough to linger in the air and move with air currents, letting them be breathed in by passersby who then get sick. Measles is a good example of this kind of virus — an exhaled measles pathogen can hang suspended in a room for a couple hours after an infected person leaves.  The reality of aerosol generation, however, is far more complex than this \"droplet\" versus \"airborne\" dichotomy would suggest, says Marr. People produce a wide range of different-sized particles of mucus or saliva. These particles get smaller as they evaporate in the air and can travel different distances depending on the surrounding air conditions.  \"The way the definitions have been set up, this \"droplet\" vs \"airborne\" distinction, was first established in the 1950s or even earlier,\" says Marr. \"There was a more limited understanding of aerosol science then.\"  Even a 5 micrometer droplet can linger in the air. \"If the air were perfectly still, it would take a half hour to fall from a height of 6 feet down to the ground. And, of course, the air isn't perfectly still,\" says Marr. \"So it can easily be blown around during that time and stay in the air for longer or shorter.\"  What's more, coughs and sneezes create turbulent clouds of gas that can propel respiratory particles forward.  \"For symptomatic, violent exhalations including sneezes and coughs, then the droplets can definitely reach much further than the 1 to 2 meter [3 to 6 feet] cutoff,\" says Lydia Bourouiba, an infectious disease transmission researcher at MIT, referring to the distance typically cited as safe for avoiding droplet-carried diseases.  How Far Can Droplets Travel?  In fact, studies show that \"given various combinations of an individual patient's physiology and environmental conditions, such as humidity and temperature, the gas cloud and its payload of pathogen-bearing droplets of all sizes can travel 23 to 27 feet,\" she wrote in a recent article published online by the Journal of the American Medical Association.  At a briefing by the White House's coronavirus task force on Tuesday, a reporter asked Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, about the potential for the coronavirus to travel 27 feet.  \"This can really be terribly misleading,\" said Fauci, who then reared his head back and mimicked making an enormous sneeze. \"If you go way back and go, 'Achoo!' And go like that, you might get 27 feet. So when you see somebody do that, get out of the way.\"  Fauci went on to say he was \"disturbed\" by headlines about the virus traveling such distances \"because that's misleading. That means that, all of a sudden, the 6-foot thing doesn't work.\"  The virus traveling distances that might be achieved after a vigorous sneeze is \"not what we're talking about\" when it comes to social distancing, Fauci said, defending the 6-foot guideline.  WHO, in its general communications with the public on such platforms as Twitter, has stated that the virus \"is NOT airborne\" and that it is mainly transmitted \"through droplets generated when an infectious person coughs, sneezes or speaks.\"  \"Transmission of COVID-19 is through droplets, it is not airborne,\" said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead for COVID-19, at a recent press briefing. \"Therefore someone who has these small liquid particles that come out of their mouth; they travel a certain distance and then they fall so that's why we recommend the physical distance, to be separated so that you remove the opportunity for that virus to actually pass from one person to another.\"  And in its technical guidance on how the virus is transmitted, WHO says that protections against airborne transmission are only needed for health-care workers when they do medical procedures which might be anticipated to produce smaller respiratory droplets that could then be inhaled.  That position has been criticized by some experts on virus transmission, however, who say so little is known about this virus that it is better to be cautious and recommend that health-care workers use N95 masks and other kinds of more protective gear for all patient care whenever possible, especially given the emerging bits of evidence that airborne transmission is a possibility.  But WHO has defended its stance.  \"This is not the WHO's opinion on its own. The WHO provides such guidelines through its networks of scientific experts from around the world,\" Balkhy told NPR.  \"It can be inhaled if you are very close to the patient, if you are creating aerosolization,\" says Balkhy. But she said past clinical experience with other severe coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, supports the idea that these viruses mainly spread via droplet transmission.  In order to conclude otherwise, she said, \"we need to have the evidence that it actually is being spread through a specific route that we're not seeing right now.\"  New Report On Airborne Transmission  Some of the strongest evidence that an airborne route of transmission might be possible for this virus comes from a report published last month by the New England Journal of Medicine that described mechanically generating aerosols carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the laboratory. It found that the virus in these little aerosols remained viable and infectious throughout the duration of the experiment, which lasted 3 hours.  WHO mentioned this study in its recent review of possible modes of transmission and noted that \"this is a high-powered machine that does not reflect normal human cough conditions ... this was an experimentally induced aerosol-generating procedure.\"  It may have been artificial, says Marr, but \"the conditions they used in that laboratory study are actually less favorable for survival compared to the real world. So it's more likely that the virus can survive under real world conditions.\"  Humans definitely produce droplets that can dry down to the sizes that were tested in that study, says Santarpia. \"Do ill people with this disease produce respiratory droplets containing the virus which dry down to those sizes? That I don't know,\" he says. \"That's the sort of piece of data that I am trying to get right now.\"  Another important piece of information for understanding the risk of airborne transmission of this disease would be knowing how much of the virus a person has to inhale in order to actually fall ill.  \"We're starting to answer the questions about how stable is this as an aerosol. We're starting to answer the questions about what kind of aerosols are people producing that have infectious virus in them,\" says Santarpia. \"The last piece of that is the infectious dose, or how many virus particles do you have to ingest or inhale to become sick.\"  He thinks it is possible that some form of airborne spread is playing a role in the transmission of this virus.  \"In my opinion, it's probably more than just droplet,\" says Santarpia, adding that intuitively it does not seem to him \"that this is just like large droplets that just sort of have ballistic trajectories and land inside your mouth that are causing disease.\"  Still, he says, \"one of the reasons we are doing the work that we are doing is that this is science and we look for proof.\"   The 6 Foot Recommendation  Generally speaking, researchers say, the 6-foot distance recommendation seems reasonable.  But if enough people gather in a room that has little or no ventilation, it's possible that even large droplets might accumulate in the air.  \"Given what we know so far about this virus, 6 feet is OK if it's not crowded. But if you are in a room or somewhere where there is a person every 6 feet, then you could have enough virus in the air that I would be concerned,\" says Marr.  Something like that might have happened when a choral group in Washington state got together to sing, and ended up with dozens of cases of COVID-19 despite the fact that members of the group were careful not to touch each other or stand close.  \"The simplest explanation is that it was being transmitted through the air,\" she says, noting that people should ventilate buildings and that concentrations of particles are less likely to build up outdoors.  She personally likes to stay 10 feet away from people, and is thinking of wearing some kind of mask for trips to the grocery store.  But even if scientific studies eventually prove that there's an airborne component to transmission, says Santarpia, that doesn't mean that you run the risk of contracting the disease from great distances, like if some stray, lonely virus particle floated into your path from way down the street.  \"I just don't think that's realistic,\" he says, adding that he's assured his aunt that it's fine for his 95-year-old grandmother to sit outside on the porch to enjoy a sunny day.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.8% in morning trading to 19,243.91. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 2.0% to 5,285.50, while South Korea's Kospi picked up 1.6% to 1,743.84. Hong Kong's Hang Seng stood at 23,517.68, up 1.5% and the Shanghai Composite gained 06% to 2,764.16.  \"Despite some respite for markets overnight, uncertainty remains as the spread of the COVID-19 virus continues,' said Zhu Huani at Mizuho Bank, warning against too much optimism.  'Central banks and authorities continue to step up measures to support the economy.'  In Asia, the Monetary Authority of Singapore eased policy Monday, and the central bank of China has also cut a key interest rate.  The overnight rally on Wall Street tacked more gains onto a recent upswing for the market, which is coming off the best week for the S&P 500 in 11 years, albeit after falling into bear market territory. Optimism is budding that the worst of the selling may be approaching, but markets around the world are still wary as leaders work to nurse their economies through the pandemic. The S&P 500 remains 22.4% below its record set last month, and oil tumbled to an 18-year low.  The S&P 500 rose 3.4% Monday for its fourth gain in the last five days.  A surge for health care stocks led the way at the week's open. Johnson & Johnson leaped 8% after saying it expects to begin human clinical studies on a vaccine candidate for COVID-19 by September. Abbott Laboratories jumped 6.4% after saying it has a test that can detect the new coronavirus in as little as five minutes.  Stocks jumped last week after the Federal Reserve promised to buy as many Treasurys as it takes to get lending markets running smoothly and Capitol Hill reached a deal on a $2.2 trillion rescue package for the economy.  \"The market wants to see everything line up, and last week everything lined up,\" said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at Edward Jones, referring to the unprecedented aid from the Fed and Congress.  Now, she said, President Donald Trump also appears to be in sync with health experts about the need to restrict the economy to slow the spread of the virus. Trump on Sunday extended social-distancing guidelines, which recommend against group gatherings larger than 10, through the end of April. Earlier, he had said he wanted the economy open by Easter.  'Now that message is in line,' said Richardson. 'All these things line up coming into this week, and that's why you saw strong performance last week continuing today.'  The S&P 500 rose 85.18 points to 2,626.65. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 3.2% to 22,327.48, and the Nasdaq gained 3.6%, to 7,774.15.  'We have to look at this rally suspiciously,' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for CFRA. He pointed to prior bear markets where stocks rallied more than 20% only to fall to new lows.  \"Granted, this bear is like no other,' he said. 'There are too many uncertainties out there for the market masses to have concluded that March 23 was the ultimate bottom.\"  Still, the 17.4% surge for stocks since last Monday has brought the first green shoots of optimism.  Forced selling by investors needing to raise cash is easing, according to Morgan Stanley strategists. They say another pullback in stocks is likely, but current levels offer some buying points for investors willing to wait six to 12 months.  'Our base case is that the lows are in for this bear market for most stocks,' they wrote in a report.  In a sign of increased caution, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 0.70% from 0.74% late Friday.  Economists expect a number of weak reports on the economy to come in through the week. The lowlight will likely be Friday's jobs report, where economists expect to see the steepest drop in the nation's payrolls since the Great Recession.  The number of known infections around the world has topped 780,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. The United States has the highest number in the world, more than 160,000.  Most people who contract COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause pneumonia and require hospitalization.  More than 37,000 have died worldwide due to COVID-19, but more than 160,000 have also recovered.  ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude added $1.44 to $21.53. It fell 6.6% to $20.09 a barrel Monday, after touching its lowest price since 2002. Oil started the year above $60 and has plunged on expectations that a weakened economy will burn less fuel. The world is awash in oil, meanwhile, as producers continue to pull more of it out of the ground.  CURRENCIES: The dollar was trading at $108.50, down from $107.57 Monday.

Forecasting firm IHS Markit said the fallout is on track to be much more severe than the recession following the 2008 financial criss.  “Real world GDP should plunge 2.8 percent in 2020 compared with a drop of 1.7 percent in 2009,” said IHS’ Nariman Behravesh, chief economist, and Elisabeth Waelbroeck-Rocha, chief international economist, in an analysis. “Many key economies will see double-digit declines (at annualized rates) in the second quarter, with the contraction continuing into the third quarter.”  Just weeks ago, IHS predicted the global economy would manage to grow by 0.7 percent this year — indicating just how swiftly the outlook has changed as more businesses shutdown and workers go home as commerce grinds to a halt.  The U.S. economy — where stores from New York to Los Angeles are closed — is expected to shrink by 5.4 percent this year. The U.K. and eurozone is projected to contract by 4.5 percent overall. Japan was already in a recession before COVID-19 hit. And China’s economy, which was hit by the outbreak first, is seen as shifting down from near-double-digit growth to an expansion of just 2 percent.  See Also: Where Fashion Stands in the COVID-19 Crisis  “It will likely take two to three years for most economies to return to their pre-pandemic levels of output,” the economists said. “More troubling is the likelihood that, because of the negative effects of the uncertainty associated with the virus on capital spending, the path of potential GDP will be lower than before. This happened in the wake of the global financial crisis.  “A sizable and aggressive policy response will help to limit the downturn and bolster the upturn,” they said. “We are beginning to see a much more effective fiscal and monetary response in recent days. While these moves are probably not big enough, they will act as circuit breakers and prevent the COVID-19 recession from becoming far worse.”  President Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion stimulus package for the U.S. on Friday, but that is only seen as lasting so long in the face of such a steep increase in unemployment. Over 3 million people were added to unemployment rolls in just a week and more applications are sure to come in.  Macy’s Inc. on Monday said it would furlough most of its roughly 125,000 employees.  “Across Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury brands, we will be moving to the absolute minimum workforce needed to maintain basic operations,” the department store said.

It was Friday, March 6, and her parents were on the cruise. She knew that their ages, 74 and 69, would make them particularly susceptible to the negative effects of the virus.  “I was very angry given that there was no doubt my parents’ lives were placed at imminent risk of serious harm,” Chalik said.  As an attorney, Chalik thought the cruise line had breached its duty to provide reasonable care for Ronald and Eva Weissberger and the rest of the ship’s 3,500-plus passengers and crew by failing to take precautions to stop the spread of the virus.  On March 9, five days after the cruise ship announced that a man on a previous voyage had died of the virus, Chalik sued on their behalf. The Weissbergers became the first cruise passengers to file suit related to coronavirus.  Experts and fellow attorneys say they face an uphill battle against restrictive terms of service buried in passengers’ paperwork and maritime laws that pre-date the sinking of the Titanic by half a century.  Nearly all legal cases are limited to losses related to physical injuries, not emotional or psychological damage. The Death on the High Seas Act, first passed in the 1920s and updated only once since, prevents survivors from suing for their emotional distress or pain and suffering even when a loved one dies on a ship at sea.  A law from 1850 still lets vessel owners limit their liability to the value of the ship. Class actions aren’t allowed. And statutes of limitations can be as short as a year.  Chalik has signed 34 clients, including two passengers from the Ruby Princess in Australia which saw hundreds of COVID-19 cases.  Her parents did not get sick. But Chalik found a clause in Princess’ tickets that allowed claims to be filed in cases of immediate danger. The company was put on notice a few weeks before her parents’ cruise, she says, by the more than 700 people infected on the Diamond Princess, nine of whom have died.  So far, she’s filed nine cases against Princess Cruises on behalf of Grand Princess, each seeking $1 million in damages. The lawsuits allege that Princess Cruises was grossly negligent for continuing to sail when it knew the ship had been infected by the previous passenger. Since then, 103 passengers from their voyage have tested positive and two have died.  In a statement, Princess Cruise Lines said it does not comment on pending litigation but “has been sensitive to the difficulties the COVID-19 outbreak has caused to our guests and crew.”  “Our response throughout this process has focused on the well-being of our guests and crew within the parameters dictated to us by the government agencies involved and the evolving medical understanding of this new illness,” the statement continued.  The industry’s slow response to initial warnings facilitated the early global spread of the COVID-19 virus. The Cruise Lines International Association, the industry’s largest trade group, waited more than a month to suspend cruise travel after confirmed cases appeared on the Diamond Princess in Japan.  Today cruise passengers remain in peril: According to SEC filings, approximately 6,000 Carnival Corp. passengers were still aboard the company's cruise ships on Monday. Four elderly passengers on Holland America’s MS Zaandam died last week, though the causes of death have not been disclosed. As of Wednesday, nine people on that ship had tested positive for COVID-19 and more than 200 passengers and crew members reported flu-like symptoms.  Even in cases of utter meltdown, experts say cruise lines are protected by a shield of immunity that can be difficult for plaintiffs to break through.  They point to the ill-fated Carnival Triumph, which lost power and plumbing in the Gulf of Mexico in 2013, leaving passengers stewing in human feces for several days. Most lawsuits went nowhere, attorneys say, and the ones that did resulted in small financial awards.  The lack of legal recourse is concerning in an industry where other oversight measures are patchy at best.  Because most cruise lines and their ships are registered outside the U.S., they do not have to comply with many domestic safety regulations. The few U.S. regulations they do have to follow – including inspections administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention if they stop at U.S. ports while sailing internationally – mask how frequently ships are cited for health and sanitation violations, according to a USA TODAY investigation.  That dramatically undercuts the normal range of incentives for companies to improve conditions, experts said.  “It’s basically lawless; they can basically conduct themselves without being held accountable,” said Spencer Aronfeld, an attorney who specializes in cruise ship litigation. “They don’t have to comply with building codes. They don’t have to comply with the ADA: they can make the steps any way they want, they can make the handrails any way they want. They don’t have to have CT scans or MRIs on the ships.”  The list goes on and on, Aronfeld says, of things cruise lines “would never get away with if they had a hotel in Miami or Las Vegas.”  Like many other industries, cruise lines are not insurers of passenger safety –meaning they’re not 100% responsible for keeping passengers in good health. But they do have a duty to take reasonable steps to keep their passengers from harm.  Michael Karcher, a maritime lawyer and professor of admiralty at University of Miami Law School, says the legal benchmark for cruise ships is “reasonable care under the circumstances.”  What is reasonable “may depend on where you are going, who are the passengers, what kind of things you are encountering,” Karcher said. “ ‘Under the circumstances’ leaves a lot of room for factual questions on both sides.”  One clear cut example is a slip-and-fall case where the passenger can prove that a design flaw on the ship, or a wet, unmarked surface left by a crew member, directly led to their injury.  But big cruise lines like Carnival Corp, the owner of Princess Cruises and more than half of the cruise market share, start limiting those circumstances and what is reasonable before passengers board the ship.  Buried in the terms of service in most passengers’ tickets are limitations on the cruise line’s liability for everything from the actions of third-party contractors – such as masseuses, nail technicians, excursion companies, even onboard doctors – to unforeseen delays in travel time.  The Grand Princess was held off the coast of California for five days waiting for authorities to allow it to dock on its return from what was supposed to have been a roundtrip from San Francisco to Hawaii. After docking in Oakland, California, it took another week to get everyone off the ship.  Martin Davies, director of the Maritime Law Center at Tulane University said that he would be “very surprised” if the cruise lines, “were liable for any delay... for being held off-shore\" because of terms of service in passengers' tickets.  “The cruise line tickets are legal works of art,’ Davies said.  Also included in the ticket contract of most cruise lines, including Princess Cruise Lines, is a waiver of class action lawsuits. Passengers on the Grand Princess or Diamond Princess exposed to or infected with coronavirus gave up their rights to sue as a group before they even boarded.  Other stipulations allow the cruise line to choose the U.S. court where claims can be filed and impose a one-year statute of limitations for filing claims – much shorter than most states’ cutoff for similar claims.  Deep in Carnival’s ticket contract, the company states it is not liable for damages for emotional distress or mental suffering. The only exception is when those damages were caused by Carnival’s negligence and resulted in a passenger “sustaining actual physical injury, or having been at risk of actual physical injury.”  Attorneys say Princess Cruise Lines may have breached its duty of care for passengers on the Grand Princess and Diamond Princess, given recent reports.  For instance, an investigation by USA TODAY found that Princess Cruise Lines had a problem with health long before the coronavirus outbreaks. Nearly 5,000 people aboard Princess ships in the past decade have suffered from bouts of vomiting, diarrhea – or both – in numbers widespread enough that government health officials issued alerts on 26 outbreaks.  But holding the company liable, especially for passengers who did not end up contracting the virus, may be a Sisyphean task.  Aronfeld blames maritime law, which allows only for cases involving physical injuries, saying they “really are designed to protect the coffers of the cruise line at the expense of injured passengers.”  That restriction is codified in U.S. Code 46, called the Shipping Act.  “Just because you see a lot of people getting sick on board and you’re freaked out by that, it doesn’t necessarily mean you can sue for mental anguish or pain and suffering,” said John H. Hickey, a maritime trial attorney in Miami, Florida.  Hickey said his firm has decided not to take such cases. Instead, they are exploring the case of a 70-year-old woman who is in the hospital and facing permanent lung damage from pneumonia caused by the coronavirus she contracted onboard.  “That is actual and permanent and severe injury,” Hickey said.  Aronfeld has fielded calls from Grand Princess passengers, some while they were still quarantined onboard. He, too, declined to take them on.  Carnival Corp denies the allegations of negligence, saying in a statement that at the time of the sailing of the Grand Princess, \"the only cruise ship with guests who had tested positive for coronavirus was the Diamond Princess in Japan (that was connected to a passenger from Hong Kong who tested positive several days later after disembarking from the ship).\"  \"At the time, the outbreak was generally believed to be secluded to China, and later, parts of Asia. There was no WHO restriction on global travel other than China,\" the statement continued.  Aronfeld sees similarities with another high-profile case that was among the largest and most challenging of his career: the Carnival Triumph disaster.  In 2013, a fire caused power and plumbing outages as the Triumph was returning to Galveston, Texas, from Cozumel, Mexico. Its route back to the U.S. via tow took nearly a week. Passengers reported raw sewage left in hazmat bags in hallways and leaking into their rooms from backed-up pipes, earning the Triumph the nickname “poop cruise.”  Despite evidence of Carnival’s negligence, including documents indicating the crew knew of generator fire hazards across the fleet before it set sail, Aronfeld says the only clients who saw any money were those who suffered from injuries like dehydration or a fall due to the blackout onboard. Most were small rewards.  Emotional injury claims did not make the cut and Aronfeld envisions the same playing out for Princess cruise passengers.  “I can just give you an example of how draconian that law is: We saw a case where a mother had a small child drown in a pool on Royal Caribbean,” he said. “As they were trying to resuscitate, they were unsuccessful, and the child died.”  According to court records, the mother sued for emotional distress, among other things, over the traumatic experience of watching her son die. The court ruled in favor of Royal Caribbean, dismissing the claim because she did not sustain an injury and the cruise line’s conduct did not rise “to the level of outrageousness” required by the law.  “If that’s not enough,” Aronfeld said, “I don’t how being confined to a luxury cabin on a Princess trip is going to be enough to survive a motion to dismiss.”  One of the most controversial pieces of maritime law is the Death on the High Seas Act.  Passed in 1920, the law initially was intended to prevent seafarers’ wives from becoming destitute if their husbands died on the water. The law covers deaths due to negligence or wrongful acts occurring 12 miles off the coast of the U.S.  The rub, experts say, is it only covers “pecuniary loss,” meaning financial loss like wages, medical and funeral costs.  If the person who dies is a retiree, a child, or unemployed, lawsuits filed by their survivors would be extremely limited.  “So grandma and grandpa go on this cruise and they get sick and they both die at sea,” said New Orleans attorney and maritime law expert Paul Sterbcow. “Their claim against the boat – to the extent to which they have one for failure to take reasonable care – is grounded in the Death of the High Seas Act and the kids recover funeral and burial expenses and that’s it.”  This may come into play for passengers on the Zaandam and sister ship MS Rotterdam, which were turned away from docking in several counties. Four passengers have died.  Andrea Bergmann Anderson, a passenger on the Zaandam, told USA TODAY that on Monday, the ship was scheduled to anchor near San Andres Island, but instead carried on. A plane was to bring in medical supplies and medically evacuate two passengers but was denied permission to land by the Colombian government, she said.  The ships, currently carrying a total of 1,200 passengers including 304 Americans are seeking to dock in Florida. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a press conference Wednesday that his state was willing to accept Floridians on board. He said officials are \"working on a solution\" to disembark other passengers, including foreign nationals, in a way that does not drain resources in South Florida, the state’s epicenter of COVID-19 cases.  Aronfeld says the morbid truth is that the cases of family members of those who died on the ship while at sea likely will be worth substantially less than a case of someone who died on land.  “Most of the people that are dying are probably retirees with no lost wage claims,\" Aronfeld said, noting the high average age of cruise passengers. “So, what’s a funeral cost? $10,000? $20,000? That's like me asking you for a penny. Carnival could pay that without missing a beat.”  Congress has made several attempts to amend or overturn the high seas law in recent years, though none have been successful.  Former Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) co-sponsored a bill in 2013 that died in committee a year later. Both Carnival and Royal Caribbean spent hundreds of thousands on lobbying that year, according to reports from Open Secrets.  In April, Sen. Deb Fischer (R-NE) introduced legislation to allow a broader range of damages to be covered. Titled “Hammer’s Law,” the bill is named after Fischer’s constituents, Larry and Christy Hammer, who died after a fire broke out on a Peruvian river cruise in 2016. The Peruvian navy found numerous safety issues on the ship that led to the fatal fire, but the Hammers’ survivors were unable to recover anything for their emotional damages.  The bill has yet to make it out of committee.  Another piece of maritime law that caught the attention of lawmakers last year is the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851, most notably used after the 1912 sinking of the Titanic. It exonerates owners of ships from the liability of loss or damages due to fire or other accidents.  Updated in 1935, it now includes any loss, damage or injury events outside of negligence or unseaworthiness that were known or should have been known by the boat owner.  In testimony to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in November, Sterbcow explained the law’s history, noting it was intended to protect the burgeoning shipping industry back when boats were made of wood and had no way of communicating from the high seas to their owners.  But in modern-day shipping, where marine insurance is readily available and technology has vastly improved – down to real-time tracking in international waters – the law can no longer be justified, Sterbcow argued.  The hearing was called by the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee after a fire in September on the Conception in California left 34 people dead.  Three days after the passengers’ deaths, the owner of the boat, Truth Aquatics, filed for protection under the Limitation of Liability Act. The owners asked the judge to limit their liability to the value of the boat after it sank, or $0.  But a lawsuit on behalf of families of three passengers and one crew member who died claims the owners knew about the dangers of the lithium-ion batteries believed to be the source of the fire. According to a report by the Los Angeles Times, a boat owned by the same company experienced a fire while charging phones and underwater cameras a year prior.  Survivors have been given a window to file claims, after which a judge will determine if the liability limitation applies.  But for attorneys like Hickey, the move by Truth Aquatics to apply for limitation before efforts to recover bodies was even complete illustrates how the law, and maritime law more broadly, is being exploited by companies.  “Talk about aggressively protecting their insurance policies and their money,” Hickey said.  In his congressional testimony, Sterbcow outlined the fallout of that problem.  “If vessel owners know they can walk away without any liability, they have no incentive to make their vessel fit,” Sterbcow said. “You need to limit the ability to limit liability.”  Despite the long odds, Sterbcow hopes that judges overseeing coronavirus cases will set new legal precedents – and the outbreaks will again catch the attention of Washington.  “I personally have been fighting this for 25 years, and just can’t get anywhere,\" he said. anywhere,” he said. “I'm hopeful now despite craziness in D.C. that...maybe we’re going to gain a little traction.”  Morgan Hines, David Oliver, Letitia Stein and Marco della Cava contributed to this report.

The five-and-a-half minute video and the accompanying post can be seen on the ski racer’s Facebook and Instagram pages.  Her post details the importance of personal hygiene to help combat the spread of COVID-19 in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado — and the world — and the importance of being kind to one another.  Shiffrin pleads with viewers to practice cleanliness, social distancing and take on the responsibility of speaking up when people in the community aren’t following those controllable actions.  “You never know what someone is going through,” Shiffrin said. “This kind of stress and panic that has been going around tends to amplify personal strife, so be kind. Stand together — separately.”  Full text from here Facebook post:  “It’s crazy to me that there are STILL people out there saying this is just some fluky thing and not covering their mouths when they cough or sneeze. Ironically those always seem to be the first people to complain about all the inconveniences they are facing, while not doing anything to mitigate the spread… I’ve seen so many heartbreaking stories of elderly being scared to go to the store to get basic necessities knowing that they are so much more susceptible to Covid-19 than the younger, healthier population. At the same time, I’ve seen heartwarming stories of people stepping up to help and reach out to make sure their elderly neighbors get what they need and stay safe. But the fact is basic personal hygiene is still lacking, which means there is more we can do to control the spread. Which in turn keeps our loved ones, parents, grandparents, friends, family, and neighbors safe. So let’s do it. Keep spreading the word, for every person you remind about washing and covering and distancing (and for every time you do these things yourself) you can essentially be saving 3 people from possible infection.

Toilet paper, rice and beans, hand sanitizer and baby wipes have been flying off of the shelves.  But store owners in Juneau say that while the coronavirus-induced panic-buying is straining their supplies, they’re confident nothing is going to disrupt their shipments, so overbuying is unnecessary.  Juneau’s Costco opens at 10 a.m. on weekdays. On Tuesday — the day many people had been waiting for the store’s shelves to be restocked — by 10:45 a.m. hundreds of cars were packed into the parking lot. The line of people waiting in the checkout line stretched from one end of the store to the other, and curved around the aisles at the back of the store.  But not everyone was in line to fill their carts — and homes — for weeks to come.  “We thought it wasn’t going to be busy,” said Kris Cole. “We were wrong.”  Cole, and Dani Cherian, like most others in the store, had a bulk package of toilet paper in their cart and a few other things. But it wasn’t full. Cherian said they were just buying a few things.  “We’re just picking up supplies for our church,” he said. They both belong to Valley Church. “We wanted to be able to help those who need toilet paper.”  But standing in line around them, there were people buying all sorts of things in preparation for being stuck in their homes. Some pushed multiple carts with toilet paper, canned and fresh food and generators in them.  Those long lines and empty shelves are something Gov. Mike Dunleavy brought up during a press conference on Monday evening.  He addressed two groups of Alaskans: First, those who appear not to be concerned by the virus, who are still gathering in large groups. He said they should take it more seriously.  “The other group of Alaskans I want to address are the folks that are very very concerned about this virus,” Dunleavy said. “So much so, that they are shopping and buying things to prepare themselves for two-to-three months without additional shopping. We’ve been told that our supply chains will be maintained, that there will be enough goods to purchase in our markets, in our stores. So we don’t have to buy a large amount of items at one time.”  Alaska Marine Lines, or AML, is a transportation company that provides barge service twice a week to Southeast Alaska.  No one from AML was available to talk on Tuesday afternoon. But they did weigh in last week, when there was a similar rush in buying in Sitka. A company representative told Sitka’s public radio station — KCAW — that things are business as usual, and the company’s schedules are running normally.  Two of Alaska’s major maritime cargo companies, Matson Inc. and TOTE Maritime, told KTUU that they are confident the virus wouldn’t disrupt shipments.  Still, the run on supplies is putting a strain on local stores.  “We do not have a food shortage. We do not have any product shortage. We just cannot get the product shipped up here fast enough,” said Super Bear store director Tony DeMelo.  He said people are panic-buying, and he thinks it’s a cycle that will probably last for a few weeks. Because as people see fewer and fewer products on store shelves, they’ll be more and more likely to want to stock up.  DeMelo said if he could talk to each person that walked into the store, he’d tell them this: It’s OK to calm down.  “Just go back home and relax,” he said. “Your 14 packages of toilet paper, your 75 pounds of rice, your 40 pounds of orange juice — all of that will still be good a month from now.”  But it’s tricky to keep up with the current spike in demand. Grocery store owners in town order on a lag. For Super Bear, that means 10-to-12 days out. So when they ordered their last shipment, they didn’t know there was going to be a frenzy of buying.  DeMelo said, in response, stores try to bump up the volume of products in their current orders, but the distributors in the Lower 48 can’t keep up the pace, because the entire country is having this problem.  Rick Wilson, who manages Foodland IGA, said that’s what’s different about this surge in buying — because there’s usually a rush at the grocery store when there’s a local disaster, like a snowstorm or hurricane. But generally that’s not happening everywhere in the country at once, so distributors can rely on stockpiles from other areas to pick up the slack.  “So they’re able to pull from areas that weren’t affected. We can’t do that. Everybody is affected,” Wilson said. “Every retailer. I mean, I’ve talked to other managers down in Washington, and they’re just in worse shape than we are. So, you know, hopefully everything will settle down a little bit. Everybody’s got their pantries full now. And I’m sure we’ll be busy, and I’m sure we’ll have some out-of-stocks. Everybody is going to be busy.”  Wilson, and other store managers, wanted it to be clear that they are receiving a steady stream of goods, and it should be enough for regular shopping — but they won’t be able to keep up with the people panic-shopping all the toilet paper.  Aside from slimmer shelves and per-person limits on certain items, there may be other changes on the way for Juneau stores. Some stores are considering senior-only shopping hours. Safeway has already made the leap: On Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., the store has asked that only seniors and other at-risk members of the community — such as pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems — shop in the store.

BDO Unibank said in an official announcement on Monday that scammers, posing as official bank personnel, have resorted to contacting bank customers and offering loan extensions while obtaining confidential data.   ADVERTISEMENT  This has occured as banks extended the payment due dates of their customers since the government imposed an enhanced community quarantine all over Luzon due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The enhanced community quarantine bars the majority of the population in the region from leaving their houses.  “With the recent move by some Philippine banks to extend the payment dues of loans and credit cards by 30 to 60 days, scammers are using the familiar ploy of sending out emails or calling customers and posing as a “legit” bank personnel offering a loan payment extension,” the bank said in a statement.  “The intention here is to get the account details and OTP (one-time password) of the customers so fraudsters can take over the account,” it added.  According to BDO, scammers try to obtain the OTP and other data from their victims by asking for their personal information, in exchange for processing the loan extensions — which is why the bank has reminded customers not to share such vital info.  “Companies send out OTPs via SMS messages as an added layer of protection. For banks, OTPs serve as an account holder’s sign off to proceed with a transaction, like paying for utility bills,” BDO explained.  “The bank warns clients about scammers pretending to be from BDO. They may offer a 60-day loan payment extension and ask for account details including OTPs, so they can proceed with transferring money to their account,” it noted.  Also, BDO advised its consumers not to click on dubious online sites to avoid hackers from stealing information.  “Fraud attacks can also come in the form of emails, SMS messages, phone calls, or messages via social media channels. Scammers introduce themselves as officials of a trusted company,” BDO reminded its customers.  “Their messages look and sound very convincing and sophisticated.

Memphis Commercial Appeal  The new drive-thru coronavirus testing center by Tiger Lane at the Mid-South Fairgrounds recently started testing a limited number of city workers with symptoms, Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland said.  The number has expanded to include some members of the public referred by medical staff, according to Dr. Scott Strome, executive dean of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center college of medicine.  The governments of Memphis and Shelby County and the UTHSC had announced creation of the drive-thru testing center on Thursday, but said the start was delayed due to equipment shortages.  On Monday, though, the site was still working through the details of the operation, or \"testing throughput,\" said Alisa Haushalter, head of the Shelby County Health Department.  The site is expected to have taken samples from up to 150 people by the end of Monday, Strome said in a news release.  The mayor said the people who are currently being tested are city workers who are showing symptoms. He described them as \"first responders,\" though it unclear if they were police, firefighters or emergency medical services employees.  \"Two reasons why they were tested. Number one, they wanted to do a limited number of people to test the apparatus of just getting it done,\" Strickland told reporters. \"Secondly, first responders are that. They are first responders. The quicker we know that somebody who is showing symptoms doesn't have the virus, the more they can still help out on the calls.\"  Strickland said that everyone tested Monday was showing symptoms, per the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Strickland said the city is hoping to ramp up testing, by appointment, later this week, but it continues to deal with the lack of testing equipment that has hamstrung efforts across the U.S. to get a handle on how many people have the coronavirus.

(Photo: Max Gersh / The Commercial Appeal)  Last week, Strickland said one Memphis Police Department employee had tested positive for the coronavirus.  Samples taken at the Tiger Lane site are being sent to commercial labs for testing. “But by later this week, we anticipate being able to use our own laboratories at UTHSC/UCH, which will considerably decrease the turnaround time (for results),” he said in the news release.  Dr. Strome said most of the individuals staffing the site are medical students who are volunteering their time. “UTHSC has about 700 medical students, and as a result of this pandemic, their education has been interrupted. This is their way of giving back to the community.”  Several Christ Community Health Services clinics are also offering COVID-19 testing. A full list of those clinics, with phone numbers, is available at commercialappeal.com.  Electric sign says 'Stay in your car'  The drive-thru testing operation had turned an area near the Liberty Bowl into something like an outdoor medical clinic.  Law enforcement officers had set up a checkpoint at the intersection of Central Avenue onto Early Maxwell Boulevard, and several Memphis Police Department and Shelby County Sheriff's vehicles stood nearby.  An electric road sign flashed \"STAY IN YOUR CAR LEAVE\" then \"YOUR WINDOWS ROLL UP.\"  An MPD officer dressed in all black clothing held up his hand to stop cars as they pulled onto Early Maxwell Boulevard, a long lane that leads to the Liberty Bowl. The officer asked each driver for their business.  He told one person hidden behind a sedan's tinted windows that he couldn't hear — the person rolled down the window a crack and he asked \"What time's your appointment?\" then \"You have an appointment at 1 o'clock?\"  Satisfied with the answer, the officer sent the car down the road, which was blocked off with orange cones and concrete barriers.  When the officer stopped another car, the driver kept his window rolled up entirely and held a slip of paper to the window. The officer gave a thumbs-up and sent the driver on his way.  The cars proceeded down a long drive and were met at a second checkpoint by a man and a woman dressed in medical scrubs, white gowns, surgical masks and face shields. The procedure wasn't entirely clear, but this appeared to be an initial screening.

Other cars proceeded down to a nearby white tent, where it appeared that an additional round of screening was taking place.  The cars then proceeded to a second tent right outside the Mid-South Coliseum. It appeared big enough to allow cars to drive straight into it.

But some professors are pretending like nothing has changed.  UCLA announced it would be moving classes online March 10 and soon moved classes online only for the entirety of spring quarter. Despite the major change, standardized exams continue to play a heavy role in determining students’ final grades.  But moving forward, this new form of teaching means a new form of testing is required.  In order to make the most out of an unfortunate situation, professors should replace final exams with research papers or creative online projects that will allow students to apply what they have learned in an engaging manner. This will not only keep students committed to the course throughout the entire quarter, no matter where that student is located, but it will also eliminate the risks of cheating all together, providing a more standardized evaluation of students’ capabilities.  The problem with administering tests online is that students will rely on excessive note taking without fully taking the time to synthesize the new material. This has been an issue in the education system even before the outbreak of COVID-19: the reliance on memorization over analysis.  In addition, even if professors rely on the academic honor code or use popular software such as Respondus to prevent cheating on exams, students will almost certainly find a work around to this. And with students now scattered around the world self-isolating, coordinating a time to take the exams that would work with 10-plus time zones is nearly impossible.  With three weeks of notice, Sarah Beckmann, an assistant professor in the classics department, said she changed the syllabus of her popular general education course, Classics 51B: “Art and Archaeology of Ancient Rome,” from a final exam to an open-ended research assignment where students can pick any digital medium they want on a topic they learned during the quarter.  “The research project allows students to do something creative with what they learned,” Beckmann said. “Ideally, other people in the class can access it and engage in that info in a fun, online platform.”  Beckmann said she considered keeping an online exam, but found that an alternative project gives students a chance to take charge of their own learning and reflect on the course instead of simply giving mechanical responses .  There are a variety of benefits to replacing traditional exams with creative projects. Projects allow students to expand upon their skills such as problem solving, research gathering and information synthesizing.  And when students are worrying about the safety of themselves and their loved ones, regurgitating facts that can be found with two clicks on Google is the last thing on their mind.  Michael Wong, a second-year electrical engineering international student staying on campus, said he’s had difficulty finding the motivation to be on top of his subjects and maintain a weekly schedule without classes, clubs and friends.  “I have been messing around with different forms of artistic expression such as music production, video editing and drawing,” Wong said. “If we were given the chance to do alternative projects (in all classes), such as the one in Classics 51B, I would have more motivation to do them and do them well.”  But creative final projects aren’t just limited to humanities courses.  Kyle Cavanaugh, an assistant professor in the geography department, is currently teaching a physical science general education class, Geography 5: “People and Earth’s Ecosystems,” and replaced a traditional final exam with a final research paper.  “A research paper goes beyond memorization and develops higher level skills,” Cavanaugh said. “It prepares students for the kinds of products they’d produce in a job setting.”  With summer session A officially moved online and the strong possibility that C session or even fall quarter will follow suit, professors must set a precedent of nontraditional testing early on.  It’s understandable why professors would want to change their syllabuses as little as possible; in times of chaos and uncertainty, some professors and students want stability in their class structures.  One could argue that replacing classic modes of examination is not feasible for all subjects. Cavanaugh noted that for some, like engineering and pre-med students, there needs to be a standard way to evaluate whether these students have a good understanding of the material. This is especially important because many of these courses are taught in a sequence and require the knowledge of the previous course.  One solution would be to create a hybrid class that combines both traditional methods and alternative ones. While a final exam can be a creative, cumulative project, the professor can administer smaller exams throughout the quarter to test specific topics of the class. Cavanaugh implemented weekly quizzes to test students’ understanding of the material, while Beckmann is administering two take-home midterms.  Since final exams are still two months away, there is plenty of time to come up with a creative solution to the online exam issue.  Because without creativity, spring classes will surely turn into a mundane blur of waiting until the quarter ends.

If someone is on parole, probation, or a pretrial release and arrested for a misdemeanor, they should be cited and not booked. The law isn’t changing for those who are arrested for serious felony offenses that are violent, involve a firearm, or related to drug distribution.  The idea is to reduce the number of people booked into jail during this global public health crisis. According to the order, “a high number of custodial arrests” would “significantly impair the functioning of [D.C.] Superior Court.” Between arrestees and staff, the high turnover at DC Jail also means it can be a hotbed for an outbreak. Approximately 10,000 individuals are booked into D.C.’s jail annually and more than 20 percent of those individuals stay for seven days or less.  On Wednesday, Deputy Chief U.S. Marshal Robert Brandt confirmed that a deputy U.S. marshal who worked in D.C. Superior Court tested positive for COVID-19. Given that they worked in the cell block and on adult and juvenile arraignments, defense lawyer James Zeigler tweeted that it’s likely there are active cases in DC Jail.  On Monday, D.C. Superior Court Chief Judge Robert Morin issued an emergency order that gave police and prosecutors the ability to issue a citation when someone is accused of a minor crime instead of having that individual detained until their first court appearance. And on Tuesday, MPD released the criteria it would follow during an arrest to meet Morin’s order during the public health emergency.  Typically, someone is not eligible for a citation release if they inaccurately report information about their name. Individuals can be detained prior to trial if they are currently on probation or parole for a misdemeanor offense; on release for a simple assault or misdemeanor weapons offense; or arrested for a traffic offense and have a pending DUI, even if no one got seriously hurt. But that all changes under the new directive. Those who’ve failed to appear before court on a previous citation are also eligible for release.  The executive order also says “members shall not charge arrestees bond or collateral in any amount in order to ensure their appearance in court. Bonds may only be issued by a judge as part of a warrant or court order.”  The Office of the Attorney General, along with the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, worked with MPD on the executive order with the intention of balancing the safety of everyone in the community. The OAG says Police Chief Peter Newsham rolled the directive out Tuesday night and expects officers were informed of it Wednesday.  “I’m expecting to see and we have already seen some significant changes in just the number of people that are being processed,” says Elizabeth Wieser, the Deputy Attorney General for the Public Safety Division at OAG. “I do think it’s going to help and I think that we are going to see that fewer people are going to be processed now and so hopefully that will make a difference.”  The Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs wrote Newsham over the weekend asking that his department reduce the number of custodial arrests during this public health emergency. The lead author of that letter is pleased that MPD issued an executive order and says lawyers with the civil rights group will be monitoring to make sure it is implemented.  “Having people in custody at this time is a public health danger to them and the community more widely,” says Emily Gunston, the deputy legal director of Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. “This is always true, but especially now: Officers need to make sure they are approaching situations with an eye towards resolving them so they will not have to take the person into custody,” she says. This is critical for officers to keep in mind when speaking with young people, in particular, who are no longer going to class because schools are temporarily closed, she adds.  Gunston and her team were still hearing from lawyers who are in D.C. Superior Court and in DC Jail a day or two ago that people were still being arrested and taken into custody even though they shouldn’t be. The Appeal reported that at least 170 people were arrested and booked over the weekend, many for low-level offenses like marijuana distribution, failing to appear in court, and driving without a license. The OAG expects this to change under the MPD executive order.  This post has been updated to correct the name of the U.S. Marshal who confirmed a positive COVID-19 test.

(NYSE: ORCL) has managed to achieve the best revenue growth in almost two years. Moreover, Oracle is the first among the large firms in tech to report figures from a period that includes the coronavirus pandemics.  Although Oracle has so far failed to challenge the biggest cloud infrastructure providers Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) whose JEDI wars aren't over just yet, neither is Oracle done trying as it has a strength of its own which its latest earnings report showed.   Q3 Earnings Report  The company has managed to increase sales 1.9% compared to last year as sales amounted to $9.8 billion, marking its best performance since May 2018 and resulting in a profit of $2.6 billion, or 79 cents a share. Before this increase, Oracle has struggled quite a bit to increase revenue as it kept posting year-over-year gains of less than 0.5% for six consecutive quarters.  After adjustments, earnings amounted to 97 cents a share. This is an increase from last year's 87 cents a share.  According to FactSet, analysts on average expected adjusted earnings of 96 cents a share on sales of $9.75 billion. The cloud license segment achieved $1.23 billion in revenue, which is down 2% but at least more than the $1.19 billion FactSet consensus estimated. However, both the company's hardware and services divisions missed expectations. Hardware was down 6% as its revenue amounted to $857 million, significantly missing the FactSet consensus was $878 million. Services revenue was down only 1% but reached $778 million whereas FactSet consensus was more optimistic at $781 million.   COVID-19  Reportedly, there has been no discernible impact on sales so far but that is due to the fact that Oracle is somewhat protected thanks to the strenghts of its business model. Its stock, however, has not been immune to the recent market tumble.  But, Oracle wasn't performing well before the coronavirus hit either as shares have declined 24.6% in the past year. Oracle shares rose as much as 4.44% immediately following the results but later lost much of their gains Thursday after hours, following already a drop of 11% during the day's trading session. The company's stock traded lower on Thursday than it had since 2017, as this was really a Black Thursday for Wall Street.   Challenges  Oracle is reportedly laying off employees in Europe, which adds to the image of encountering difficulties to achieve promised revenue growth as it attempts to catch up with cloud peers. If we also consider the significantly slower pace of hiring that took place since September last year, it is obvious that the path to the cloud is presenting structural challenges for the company. As for its guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, as the case with other companies, it was left wide due to the COVID-19 uncertainty.  The projected revenue ranges from a decline of 2% to a gain of 2% resulting in a range of $10.92 billion to $11.36 billion. The middle of the range for quarterly revenue guidance was slightly lower than expected as analysts estimated $11.31 billion. Adjusted earnings guidelines were in the range of $1.20 to $1.28 a share in which FactSet analyst estimates of $1.23 do fit in.   Competitors  Oracle's leadership position in enterprise databases should position it well for cloud-enabled database services. However, it is unlikely that it could become a serious threat to Amazon and Microsoft. Meanwhile, another cloud software giant Salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRM) also has managed to beat the latest earnings estimates for the 12th consecutive quarter on Feb. 25 as its e-commerce traffic surged in Q4. According to Salesforce, the increased prevalence of mobile wallet solutions such as Apple Pay (NASDAQ: AAPL) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) has had its fair share in changing consumer behaviour when it comes to shopping. But both of these companies have issued revenue warnings of the COVID 19 impact so let's hope that the strong increase in e-commerce that benefited many digital retailers won't be contaged, not to say diminished entirely, by the coronavirus.  Salesforce is also San Francisco's largest private employer as it has more than 7,000 employees in the city itself. Therefore, the responsible thing to do was to ask its employees in California to work remotely in March due to the pandemics so there will be some impact on its workings. But this is surely a company who can protect its system well from any hacking attempts.   Outlook For Oracle  On the bright side, analysts appreciate Oracle's execution capacity and find it to be among the best in the industry. During the past two recessions, it has successfully increased its margins thanks to its ability to cut costs rapidly. And overall, the third quarter earnings report pleased investors as it showed that cloud subscriptions succeeded at driving growth.  There's no arguing that Oracle's revenue growth has slowed recently as the company continues to navigate a path to the cloud but there is evidence that it has decisively shifted toward a more predictable subscription model that will continue pushing its revenues and profit up.

Along with the firing of its staff members, the league created by the wrestling genius has no plans of returning for a second season in 2021.  ESPN is reporting that only a handful of executives remain employed by the XFL, which possibly leaves room for a return in the future. The league canceled its second season after teams played only five games as almost the entire country closed down due to COVID-19.  On Friday afternoon, XFL CEO Jeffrey Pollack contacted all employees on a 10-minute conference call to advise them of the league’s direction. There is some confusion as to whether Commissioner Oliver Luck is still with the company as he did not speak during the call.  The XFL had just one season during its initial run back in 2001, and it surprised a lot of people when McMahon revealed plans to bring it back. It was set to compete with the new Alliance of American Football, which had one season in 2019 and folded after filing for bankruptcy.  The XFL was bringing in more significant numbers as far as attendance and TV ratings, but they were lowering as the season went on.  The grades are in. ⁣   ⁣  Take a look at the highest-graded players of the season according to @PFF. pic.twitter.com/kSRbARiYyF — XFL (@xfl2020) April 8, 2020  Pollack never went as far as to say that the XFL is no longer in business, but one source said, “It’s done. It’s not coming back.”  Upon the postponement of the season last month, the league stated that it would not be back to finish in 2020. The XFL let fans know that they could get a refund on their 2021 ticket investment due to not knowing when things would get started again.  In March, the NBA was the first professional league to suspend its season due to the coronavirus pandemic. The NHL, MLB, MLS, NCAA, and other leagues around the world began following their lead, but they are all expected to return later in 2020 or next year.  The original version of the XFL folded as fans thought it was too much of a combination of football and professional wrestling. McMahon had different rules for the 2020 league; it was going to have a strict focus on football and not be associated with WWE at all.  On Friday, Pollack never came right out and said that the XFL would not return at all, but 2021 is already out of the picture. The league was starting to pick up momentum right before its season was suspended, and there has been no further comment regarding the distant future.

Across the country, these informal online groups—also called “mutual aid” groups—help communities stay connected at a time when people must practice social distancing to stay safe.  AARP Community Connections includes multiple resources to help those who are feeling isolated, depressed, overwhelmed or anxious.  Users are able to request a call from an AARP volunteer, or a trained counselor; easily create an account with Savo to make connecting with their families easier; and join “The Mighty,” a safe, supportive online community for people facing health challenges and their caregivers.  Social isolation was a common problem, even before the coronavirus pandemic: A 2020 study, published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine and supported by AARP Foundation, reported 43 percent of adults age 60 or older said they had felt lonely. And, while social isolation and loneliness are serious health issues by themselves, they can also exacerbate existing health problems, such as lung disease, heart disease and diabetes. AARP Community Connections helps people reach out to volunteers in their community who are willing to help their neighbors with their unique needs.  AARP Community Connections is live and completely free to use, and AARP membership is not required. For more information, visit www.aarpcommunityconnections.org.

Lockdowns that have kept millions of people in their homes — and social distancing measures meant to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus — have brought clear skies, quiet streets and tranquil shores.  These are challenging times for humanity. But for many of Earth's other inhabitants, there's a silver lining.  Animals are not dramatically rebounding in the absence of humans, but they are timidly pushing their boundaries, with sika deer showing up outside their normal habitat in the park in Nara, Japan, wild turkeys showing up in a park in Oakland, California, and orcas venturing farther up Vancouver's Burrell Inlet than they typically do.  Thanks to the absence of cruise ships, dolphins have returned in greater numbers to the Italian port of Cagliari. And the presence of swans in the canals of Burano sparked a flurry of social media attention, even though swans are often seen in this small island in the greater metro area of Venice.  The bears and other animals of Yosemite have been having a \"party\" since the park closed on March 20, says a ranger and biologist who has been studying the park's bears for more than a decade.  In a Yosemite Facebook Live event, Ranger Katie talks about why Yosemite Valley is such a \"paradise\" for bears, regardless of the presence of humans, but especially in the spring.  There are typically so many humans and cars at this time of year that the bears have to pick their paths carefully to avoid them.  \"Navigating that landscape, where there are lots of people, is difficult,\" she said. But that’s not the case now. \"Bears are literally walking down the road to get to where they need to go, which is kind of cool.\"  For example, the video below shows a bear strolling through a meadow that would typically be filled with human gawkers.  And then there were the not-so-timid goats roaming around Llandudno, in northern Wales, helping themselves to the shrubbery:  \"If anything, these times may serve as a reminder that animals have always lived in our area,\" Seth Magle, who directs the Urban Wildlife Institute at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, told The Guardian. \"We may not think of our cities as a part of nature, but they are.\"  Regardless, this kind of reverse habitat-encroachment is comforting.   Nature hates a vacuum  When humans move out of a space, animals move in as these horses did in the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear accident. Kate Siomkina/Shutterstock  We've seen this kind of animal renaissance before, in the wake of very different catastrophes.  At the site of the former Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant — where a 2011 meltdown forced the evacuation of thousands of people — animals like wild boar, macaques, and Japanese hares are flourishing.  And, more than 30 years after the Chernobyl disaster, Geiger counters still scold furiously at lingering radiation levels in the area — but wildlife have made an unlikely comeback.  It's not all good news for animals  While some animals are certainly relishing in the retreat, other animals that have come to rely on humans may actually miss us.  Like the macaques of Lopburi, Thailand. Spending their days loafing around the city's famed Phra Prang Sam Yot monkey temple, these primates have become all-too accustomed to human handouts. But with the coronavirus keeping tourists at bay — and handouts increasingly rare — they've gone all \"Gangs of New York\" on each other.  You can check out some of the mayhem in the video below:  \"The fall in tourist numbers because of COVID-19 may have indeed brought about a shortage of food supply for them,\" Asmita Sengupta, an ecologist at the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment in India, tells The New York Times.  \"Once they get used to being fed by humans, they become habituated to humans and even display hyper-aggression if they are not given food.\"  On the other hand, the goats in Wales don't mind. And, as more countries ground their citizens, experts suggest animals will take full advantage.  \"I've seen what's happened in [other cities] and we've been thinking about what that means in the UK as well for wildlife,\" Martin Fowlie, media manager for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, tells Express.  \"Since World War 2, UK wildlife has been in general decline, there are some species doing better, but on the whole, the majority of species have been doing less well.\"  But the hushing of cities and towns and countrysides, he adds, may not only benefit animals. Humans too may soon emerge from their homes with a new understanding of their relationship with the natural world. We might even look to preserve that kind of peace.

The Asian man quietly leaned against the subway door, while the angry passenger moved around the relatively empty train.  “Tell him to move!” the black man, wearing a gray-and-white jacket, said.  When a fellow passenger off-camera asked him why the Asian man needed to move, the aggressive passenger replied: “Because he’s standing right f*cking next to me!”  After the Asian passenger refused to respond, the black man grabbed a purple bottle and began spraying it right in front of his fellow train rider. The disinfectant was believed to be a Febreze bottle, the New York Post reported on March 5. He then leaned in an adjacent door facing the Asian man.  “You don’t want to move I’ll fight you. You better move,” the black man repeated.  The Asian man confronted the angry passenger in a second video. The black man was already seated when the Asian asked: “Why is that? Why can’t I sit next to you?” Before things could escalate, a woman pulled the Asian man away.  Chinese-American actress Celia Au condemned the angry passenger’s “racist” behavior on her Twitter account last Thursday, March 5.  “There’s not a single confirmed case of an Asian infected in NYC,” Au declared. “Stop discriminating cause the virus definitely doesn’t.”  There's not a single confirmed case of an Asian infected in NYC.

The 33-year-old Welshman, the 2018 Tour winner, began the first of his three 12-hour stints on the online virtual cycling and running platform Zwift from the confines of his garage in Cardiff on Wednesday.  “Going up Alpe d’Huez and (Mont) Ventoux would be easier for sure... it’s just so mundane here,” Thomas told Reuters. “Obviously, I’ve got some things going on, a few interviews, I’m on Zwift and I can ride with people, but 12 hours just stuck in a garage is totally different to riding on the road.  “At least going up Alpe d’Huez you’ve got all the hairpins and writing on the road... this is a challenge in itself.”  Thomas said that he was “a bit nervous” about riding for 36 hours, the equivalent of several stages of the Tour.  “This morning when I woke up, I was a bit like ‘phwoah, what am I doing?’ But to see all the money coming in makes it all worthwhile,” Thomas added.  “I saw all the stuff in the news and I have a few friends and family that are involved and, yes, just the sacrifice that everyone is making I think it’s amazing and I really wanted to make a small difference myself.”  Cycling’s governing body UCI announced on Wednesday that the Tour, initially due to be held from June 27-July 19, would be staged from Aug. 29-Sept. 20.  Speaking before the official announcement, Thomas said the disruptions to the cycling season this year were tough.  “I was in France until towards the end of March and I was training really well and staying positive and thinking of the next races,” he added.  “But as the weeks went on, they were getting cancelled, came back here and had a little break because I’d done quite a lot of training... it’s just tough mentally to stay switched on because you don’t know exactly what (event) you’re going to be racing next.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 1, "positive": 4, "negative": 2, "anger": 3, "surprise": 1, "trust": 2}, "metadata": ["france", "online", "virtual"]}, {"text": "People are baiting Instacart shoppers with big tips on their orders and then changing them to zero once they have their items.  Users of the app are offering to pay people huge tips to collect their shopping for them, so they don’t have to leave the house during the coronavirus pandemic, according to CNN.  Instacart has seen a surge in popularity in the last few weeks, as more people are staying inside, amid stay-at-home orders and social distancing advice.  Annaliisa Arambula told the outlet that she accepted an order in March, that was local and came with a $55 tip.  Ms Arambula picked up the order and dropped it off to the customer, but when she got home she saw a message that read: “Customer modified the tip post-delivery”.   Loading....  The modified figure was $0 and she said: “I was flabbergasted. I couldn’t believe it,” and added that “it’s very demoralising”.  The outlet report that Ms Arambula’s husband has diabetes, so is classified as high risk for the virus.  He is also unemployed, so Ms Arambula is the sole provider of income, and she feels that she is being put at risk of contracting Covid-19 when she goes outside, only for people to modify her tip.  “I don’t pretend to be a hero, like a nurse in a hospital ... but I literally am exposing myself (to coronavirus) and when I return home, exposing my own family to the possibility of transmitting this disease,” she said.  “When you know that it’s somebody who’s just doing it to game the system and to get their order when they want it, it’s really frustrating.”  Carilyn, who only gave CNN her first name, had her tip modified to $0 recently, when a shopper felt it was unethical that she couldn’t find them toilet paper.  “I tried my best. A lot of people are detached from the situation going on,” she said. “They really don’t see what we see. We know things are a no-no, like soap, and toilet paper, you barely find eggs if you’re lucky.”  A spokesperson for Instacart told CNN that they recently changed their settings so that users have to manually put $0 in as the tip, in an attempt to deter people from the practice.

Authorities in the country are apologizing to his family and dropping their reprimand, six weeks after his death from the disease caused by the virus.  Widely known as a whistleblower who spoke up about the outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China, the 34-year-old doctor was initially punished by local authorities. They said he was \"spreading rumors\" in early January, after he had tried to warn others about the emergence of the novel coronavirus that has now become a global pandemic.  By the time the young doctor died of COVID-19 in early February, the virus had already claimed hundreds of lives. To date, more than 3,000 people have died of the virus in mainland China.  News of his death, coupled with accusations that the government was covering up the outbreak, triggered an avalanche of outrage from a wide cross-section of Chinese society. In response to popular demand, the central government dispatched investigators two days later to look into the circumstances surrounding his police reprimand and death.  Beijing's investigators now conclude that Wuhan authorities acted \"inadequately\" when they reprimanded the late doctor and failed to follow \"proper law enforcement procedure.\" They did not, however, explain what the correct response should be.  Investigators also characterized his efforts to sound the alarm on the coronavirus as a positive influence that aided in raising awareness.  Shortly after the official findings were published, Wuhan police announced that the two officers responsible for improperly reprimanding Li have been disciplined.  Copyright 2020 NPR.

Britain imposed a nationwide lockdown just over a week ago, and the All England Club announced after a two-day emergency meeting that the event it refers to simply as The Championships is being scrapped for 2020. That hadn't happened since 1945.  Wimbledon was scheduled to be played on the club's grass courts on the outskirts of London from June 29 to July 12.  Instead, the next edition of the tournament will be June 28 to July 11, 2021.  Also Wednesday, the ATP and WTA announced that the men's and women's professional tours would be suspended until at least July 13, bringing the number of elite tennis tournaments affected by the coronavirus to more than 30. The top tours already had been on hold through June 7. Lower-level events on the Challenger Tour and ITF World Tennis Tour also are called off through mid-July now.  Wimbledon first was held in 1877 and has been contested every year since, with the exception of two stretches: from 1915-18 because of World War I, and from 1940-45 because of World War II.  “It has weighed heavily on our minds that the staging of The Championships has only been interrupted previously by World Wars,” club chairman Ian Hewitt said in a press release, “but, following thorough and extensive consideration of all scenarios, we believe that it is a measure of this global crisis that it is ultimately the right decision to cancel this year's Championships, and instead concentrate on how we can use the breadth of Wimbledon's resources to help those in our local communities and beyond.”  Wimbledon joins the growing list of sports events called off completely in 2020 because of the COVID-19 outbreak.  That includes the Tokyo Olympics — which have been pushed back 12 months — and the NCAA men's and women's college basketball tournaments.  Wimbledon is the first major tennis championship wiped out this year because of the coronavirus. The start of the French Open was postponed from late May to late September.  Shortly after the news came from Wimbledon, the U.S. Tennis Association issued a statement saying it “still plans to host the U.S. Open as scheduled,” from Aug. 31 to Sept. 13 in New York.  Wednesday's decision by the All England Club means Novak Djokovic and Simona Halep will not get a chance to defend their Wimbledon titles from 2019.  “We are going through something bigger than tennis and Wimbledon will be back!” Halep wrote on social media. “And it means I have even longer to look forward to defending my title.”  Serena Williams retweeted the club's message about the cancellation and wrote: “I'm Shooked.”  The move also takes away what might have been one of Roger Federer's best chances to try to add to his 20 Grand Slam titles, including a record eight at Wimbledon. Federer, who turns 39 in August, is currently recovering from knee surgery and planned to return in time for the European grass-court circuit that now has been erased from the calendar.  In a statement last week, the All England Club said that postponing the two-week event would not come \"without significant risk and difficulty\" because of the grass surface. The club also said then that it ruled out \"playing behind closed doors\" without spectators.  Hundreds of thousands of people have caught COVID-19, and thousands have died. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough, but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization.  Regular day-to-day life has come to a halt in many ways in many parts of the world in recent weeks, and sports has reflected that.  The NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball are on hold indefinitely; the Kentucky Derby, Masters and Indianapolis 500 were pushed back several months until September; England's Premier League and other club soccer competitions are currently suspended; the European soccer championship — scheduled to end in London on the same day as the Wimbledon men's final — was postponed from 2020 to 2021.   ------  Follow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at https://twitter.com/HowardFendrich   ------  More AP Tennis coverage: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 10, "positive": 16, "negative": 6, "joy": 1, "anger": 2, "surprise": 1, "fear": 7, "trust": 2}, "metadata": ["coronavirus", "britain", "nationwide", "lockdown", "england", "london", "global", "crisis", "cancel", "college", "postponed", "wednesday's", "williams", "surgery", "fever", "requiring"]}, {"text": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday encouraged thousands of medical, health and nursing students across the state to join the state’s new Health Corps initiative to help the state fight the effects of the coronavirus. Newsom launched the initiative Monday to increase the number of health care professionals needed to fight the pandemic which is expected to surge in upcoming weeks.  “If you’re a nursing school student or a medical school student, we need you,” Newsom said. “If you just retired in the last few years, we need you.” Newsom also announced that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is providing stipends to Health Corps workers through a $25 million donation to cover transportation, child care support and hotel rooms.  Newsom said the state could add about 37,000 healthcare workers, including those who are retired and students. To help them join the workforce, Newsom signed an executive order allowing state licensing boards to waive some of their requirements and decide how they would issue temporary licenses.  But the creation of the new Corps and Newsom’s call to action doesn’t completely resolve an issue that would delay up to 14,000 nursing students from graduating and getting into the workforce just when the state needs them.  Some students and instructors, who have been eager to answer the state’s call to help stop the spread of the virus wanted the governor to go a step further and order the California Board of Registered Nursing to temporarily change its policy on clinical rotations to allow them to graduate on-time or ahead of schedule.  These rotations, which are normally done in hospitals with students shadowing nurses and doctors across various specialties as they care for patients, are needed for graduation. Students, for example, rotate through an emergency room or pediatrics of a hospital as part of their training. The state requires colleges to have at least 75 percent of these clinical rotations with patients, but the COVID-19 crisis has suspended those activities.  One solution offered by nursing instructors and students across the state would be lowering the percentage of clinical rotations conducted with patients from 75 percent to 50 percent. Students would complete the other 50 percent of their clinical practice through what are called “virtual simulations,” which recreates the health care situations and incidents online, especially since many campuses have moved their in-person instruction online. Current regulations allow 25 percent of clinical rotations to be completed with simulations.  Newsom’s order allows the state Department of Consumer Affairs, which oversees the nursing board, to waive licensing requirements and change the scope of practice of healthcare professions through June 30. The department must work with each licensing board to determine exactly what will change.  “We are encouraging all interested medical and health care professionals to register for the California Health Corps,” said Veronica Harms, a spokeswoman for the department. “As for waivers, we are looking at all of our options to expand and grow the health care workforce during the pandemic.”  Once specific waivers are issued, Harms said they would be published on the department’s website.  But Sharon Goldfarb, dean of health sciences at the College of Marin in Kentfield north of San Francisco and president of the northern division of the California Organization of Associate Degree Nursing, said she’s seen no evidence that the nursing board wants to help solve this problem. “We appreciate Gov. Newsom’s initial response but what he’s done is put the power in the (nursing board’s) hands and they’re not doing anything,” she said.  Goldfarb, who has been contacting state lawmakers and the nursing board to make changes, said the board has been slow to act.  “I don’t know what we can do but go back to writing legislators and getting students to be politically active. But we’re on a timeline. Our semester is ending.”  State Sen. John Moorlach, R-Costa Mesa, called the Health Corps a “critical first step,” but it is essential the consumer affairs department eases barriers for medical professionals wanting to help with the coronavirus response, he said.  “I sent a letter last week requesting the California Board of Registered Nursing adjusts its strict clinical hour graduation requirements for nursing students,” he said. “Until this issue is fully resolved, I will continue to monitor the situation and work to ensure the bureaucracy does not get in the way of patient care.”  Lisa Rients, a nursing student, nearing graduation in May from West Coast University in Anaheim, said she was disappointed that the clinical rotation requirements hadn’t been changed yet. She won’t sign up for the corps until she knows what the board decides about the requirements, Rients said.  California Community Colleges Chancellor Eloy Ortiz Oakley applauded the creation of the Health Corps and said the state’s 115 community colleges would do what it could to increase the number of workers in nursing, respiratory therapy and other health fields. “The new, temporary flexibility with regard to state licensing and certification and professional scopes of work announced by Gov. Gavin Newsom today will make this easier to get qualified health students in the workforce,” Oakley said.  Corps volunteers will be reviewed based on their skills, experience, location preferences and interests, according to the site. Those who participate in the corps will be paid and given malpractice coverage.  It’s not immediately clear what effect being in the Health Corps will have on medical and health students who are nearing graduation, or when they would be able to complete licensing requirements.  Andrew Gordon, the associate director of media relations for the University of California, said there “currently no systemwide plans to accelerate graduation for our medical or health students, but we will continue to assess the feasibility and implications of this and other strategies, given the rapid developments around the pandemic and our dedicated efforts to help combat it.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 29, "positive": 26, "negative": 5, "disgust": 2, "anger": 6, "surprise": 2, "fear": 6, "trust": 7}, "metadata": ["california", "nursing", "students", "professionals", "pandemic", "surge", "facebook", "ceo", "donation", "healthcare", "workforce", "virus", "hospital", "crisis", "in-person", "college", "san", "northern", "lawmakers", "eases", "coronavirus", "strict", "ensure", "university", "respiratory", "flexibility", "andrew", "media"]}, {"text": "Therapy and O.C.D. in the time of coronavirus  Exposure and response prevention therapy is the most effective treatment, experts say. It systematically tests a patient’s worries that something will harm them by exposing them in a prolonged, repetitive and intensifying system to things that they fear.  When the exposure doesn’t cause significant illness or harm, the patients can begin to learn how to better cope.

In some situations, he said, patients are asked to touch toilet seats or bathroom floors, and then are given food to eat before washing their hands.  “As you can see, the world we live in today, that collides head on with that kind of treatment intervention,” he said. “It has been very challenging to try to achieve a balance where you are keeping your staff and patients as safe as we all can be, yet still providing effective treatment.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 8, "positive": 8, "negative": 2, "disgust": 2, "joy": 4, "anger": 1, "fear": 3, "trust": 1}, "metadata": ["coronavirus", "sanitation", "virus", "professionals", "behavioral", "bathroom"]}, {"text": "When Ireland's acting Prime Minister decided to go into politics, he put his medical career behind him.

That is in spite of President Trump's insistence that the situation is improving. As NPR's Kirk Siegler reports, many people who are sick and showing likely symptoms say they still can't get tested.  KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: For the past two weeks in Lillian, Ala., Nathan Tetreault (ph) has suffered through the likely COVID-19 symptoms - dry cough, fever, waking up in the middle of the night struggling to breathe.  NATHAN TETREAULT: I don't know if I have it. However, chances are pretty darn likely.  SIEGLER: Because he didn't meet the required criteria early on, doctors wouldn't test him last week. He's not over 65 showing symptoms. He hasn't traveled outside the country or knowingly come into contact with anyone who has tested positive.  TETREAULT: The scariest thing is not getting answers, not knowing what's going to happen when you call the doctor and they're just like, yeah, you're on your own.  SIEGLER: Tetreault is feeling better. He's supposed to go back to his job at a supermarket. He says if he knew he was positive, he could ask for more time off. He's worried he could be infectious. While COVID-19 testing criteria can vary depending where you live, tests are being rationed in every state, and demand is far outstripping capacity from Alabama to Oregon.  MELISSA BURGESS: I do have a little bit of a cough still, so I apologize.  SIEGLER: In Portland, Melissa Burgess (ph), her husband and their 1 1/2-year-old son have been holed up in their small house for two weeks. She had mild symptoms. Her husband, though, got much sicker - but not bad enough to go to the ER or get a test according to their doctor. Now he is getting better.  BURGESS: And so maybe it wasn't that. And just thank God. You know? But the anxiety of that, you know, in the past few days has been pretty high.  SIEGLER: Still, Burgess isn't taking any chances. She wears the family's one mask when she cares for her husband. They're worried that if she gets sick, there will be nobody to take care of their son. Now, usually her parents help out, but they can't come over and risk getting sick themselves.  BURGESS: The point being that, like, if everyone was able to just get a test to know if they had it or not, then we could at least have comfort in knowing that, like, someone could take care of our son.  SIEGLER: People who responded to a callout on social media were frustrated that testing is still being rationed and not everyone who's showing symptoms can get one. A Colorado woman said her husband is sick, their son has leukemia, and yet their doctor said the only thing they could do for now is to isolate at home. There are signs that more testing is becoming available more widely with some caveats. Here in Idaho, Blaine County reports some of the highest rates of COVID-19 infections in the U.S. A woman there in her 30s was able to get tested. But because she wasn't that sick, her swab was sent to a commercial lab. She got the positive results 12 days later.  ABNER KING: We've never had a sufficient test capacity from the beginning of this whole ordeal.  SIEGLER: Abner King is CEO of Syringa Hospital in rural northern Idaho. Most of their tests are sent to a commercial lab in California which has its own backlog to deal with.  KING: We have a lot of people that want to get tested and that are upset when the screening criteria says, no, you don't qualify to get tested. And they'll literally go to the next hospital down the road and try there. But we're all in the same boat.  SIEGLER: King just hopes people in his community who think they might be sick are heeding the stay-at-home order. That's not of much solace to people like Michelle (ph) Burgess and her family over in Portland.  BURGESS: We don't blame the doctors for this at all. Like, they are working and so hard. I think they're in a hard position to have to tell people, no, we can't, you know, prescribe you a test right now because there aren't enough.  SIEGLER: Burgess says state health officials have tried to reassure her that the testing criteria is changing and possibly getting less stringent by the day.  Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Boise.

ADVERTISEMENT  The latest data was announced by Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire in an interview on dzBB.  On Saturday, there were 307 confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 17 deaths and 13 recoveries.  Vergeire said the number of COVID-19 cases is expected to increase in the coming days because of continuous testing.  “Ang ating mga laboratoryo ay nag-iistabilize na ang capacity. Ibig sabihin nito ay nakakahabol na tayo sa backlogs before. Na-extend na natin ang kapasidad sa ibang laboratories,” she said.  (The capacity of our laboratories is now stabilizing. We’re now catching up with our backlogs. This is because we also have extended the capacity of other laboratories.)  Vergeire added that the expected rise of confirmed cases in the coming days may be “artificial” because of the test results that had been delayed in the past.  Previously, it was only the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa City which had the capacity to test patients for COVID-19. Test results were released within 24 to 48 hours.  On Friday, the Department of Health activated four other laboratories capable of testing for COVID-19: San Lazaro Hospital in Manila, Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City and Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City.  The DOH will also put up testing centers in Western Visayas Medical Center in Iloilo City and Bicol Public Health Laboratory in Legazpi City.

I’M STEVE BOTTARI GOVERNOR JANET MILLS AND THE MAINE CDC UPDATING THE LATEST CORONAVIRUS EFFORTS IN OUR STATE LIST. GO TO TO AUGUSTA LIVE TO LISTENING. ON THE COVID-19 SITUATION ACROSS THE STATE OF MAINE TODAY’S UPDATE STARTS ON A SOMBER NOTE. MAINE CDC IS AWARE OF THE PASSING OF A WOMAN IN HER 70S FROM YORK COUNTY. WHO PASSED AWAY WITH CORONAVIRUS? AS ALWAYS OUR THOUGHTS GO OUT TO THE FAMILIES OF THIS INDIVIDUAL DURING THIS TIME OF MOURNING AND GRIEVING. OVERALL MAINE CDC IS AWARE NOW OF 734 CASES OF CORONAVIRUS. AN INCREASE OF 36 CASES SINCE YESTERDAY. THE BULK OF THESE CASES REMAIN IN CUMBERLAND COUNTY OVERALL 124 INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED AT SOME POINT DURING THEIR CORONAVIRUS ILLNESS. AND AT PRESENT 37 INDIVIDUALS ARE HOSPITALIZED IN REGULAR HOSPITAL BEDS. 21 ARE IN INTENSIVE CARE UNITS AND NINE INDIVIDUALS ARE ON VENTILATORS RELATED TO THEIR CORONAVIRUS ILLNESS. THIS IS AGAIN AN IMPORTANT REMINDER THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE CASES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT ARE IN ACTUALITY INDIVIDUALS. THE FRIENDS AND COMMUNITIES AND OUR PRIMARY GOAL IS TO WISH THEM AND HELP THEM ALONG THE PATH TO A SPEEDY RECOVERY. WITH THE INCLUSION OF THE LATEST INDIVIDUAL WHO PASSED AWAY MAINE CDC IS NOW AWARE OF 20 DEATHS STATEWIDE RELATED TO CORONAVIRUS. IN ADDITION 292 INDIVIDUALS HAVE RECOVERED AND SINCE THE BEGINNING OF OUR ACTIVATION MAINE CDC EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND CLINICAL STAFF HAVE FIELDED 4751 CONSULTATION REQUEST. I’D LIKE TO PROVIDE A BRIEF UPDATE ON THREE FACILITY-LEVEL OUTBREAKS THAT MAINE CDC STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING ON. THE FIRST INVOLVES THE TALL PINES FACILITY IN WALDO COUNTY THERE ARE CURRENTLY A TOTAL OF 24 CASES ASSOCIATED WITH TALL PINES. 19 AMONG RESIDENTS AND FIVE AMONG STAFF THE NEXT IS THE MAINE VETERANS HOME IN SCARBOROUGH. WERE THERE ARE A TOTAL OF 38 CASES OF CORONAVIRUS? SPLIT BETWEEN STAFF AS WELL AS RESIDENTS. AN INCREASE OF SIX SINCE YESTERDAY. AND THE THIRD IS THE AUGUSTA CENTER FOR HEALTH AND REHABILITATION. WERE THERE ARE TOTAL OF SIXTY THREE CASES OF CORONAVIRUS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT FACILITY? AN INCREASE OF EIGHT CASES SINCE YESTERDAY. I’D LIKE TO TURN NEXT TO AN UPDATE ON OUR LABORATORY IN AUGUSTA. ONE OF THE TOP PRIORITIES OF OUR LABORATORY RIGHT NOW IS TO ASSIST FACILITIES WITH RAPID TESTING OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE OR MAY HAVE CORONAVIRUS IN CONNECTION WITH THAT OUR LABORATORIES PREPARING KITS THAT CAN BE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS FACILITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE SWABS THAT ARE NECESSARY CAN BE DONE APPROPRIATELY QUICKLY AND SENT TO OUR LABORATORY IN AUGUSTA. OVERALL OUR LABORATORY CONTINUES TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT TESTS AND RETURN RESULTS WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 24 HOURS AND THERE IS CURRENTLY NO BACKLOG OF ANY TEST. AND OVERALL OUR TESTING CAPACITY AT THE MAINE CDC LAB REMAINS AT APPROXIMATELY 3,000 TESTS. THAT BEING SAID WE ARE AWARE OF CHALLENGES IN OBTAINING REAGENTS THE CHEMICALS THAT CONDUCT THE TEST. WE ARE AWARE OF THOSE CHALLENGES IN THE SUPPLY OF THOSE REAGENTS AT A NATIONAL LEVEL IN OUR LAB TEAM CONTINUES TO ORDER MORE SUPPLIES TO MAKE SURE OUR TESTING CAPACITY REMAINS ROBUST. I’D LIKE NEXT TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON OUR SHIPMENTS AND DELIVERIES OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT ACROSS THE STATE. AS A REMINDER PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT OF ALL SORTS IS WORN BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IN ORDER TO HELP THEM STAY SAFE AND GUARD AGAINST CORONAVIRUS. PPE AS IT’S KNOWN HAS BEEN A SCARCE RESOURCE NATIONWIDE. AND ONE OF OUR TASKS AT MAINE CDC IS TO JUST IS TO DISTRIBUTE PPE ACROSS THE STATE IN A FAIR AND EQUITABLE FASHION. YESTERDAY MAINE CDC STAFF WORKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION FILLED 116 ORDERS FOR PPE COMPRISING 67,000 TOTAL PIECES TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE THAT IS FIVE FULL CARGO VANS OF PPE THAT WERE SHIPPED IN CONCERT WITH OUR PARTNERS AT DOT JUST YESTERDAY. OF THE 116 ORDERS ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THEM WENT TO CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES SUCH AS NURSING HOMES. OTHER CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES THAT WE KNOW ARE AT HIGH CONCERN AND HIGH RISK FOR OUTBREAKS. I’VE GOT THE BREAKDOWN ON WHAT WE PROVIDED AND WE’RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT TO ANYBODY BUT AT A HIGH LEVEL WE SHIPPED OUT CLOSE TO 4095 MASKS. OVER 26,000 SURGICAL MASKS 4600 FACE SHIELDS ALMOST 28,000 GLOVES OVER 400 PROTECTIVE SUITS ABOUT 4,500 SURGICAL SURGICAL GOWNS JUST YESTERDAY ALONE. I’LL WORK ON THAT DISTRIBUTION IS CONTINUING. TODAY MAINE CDC STAFF AGAIN WORKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. ARE SHIPPING OUT 30 ORDERS FOR PPE. SIMILARLY THE BULK OF THOSE ORDERS ARE GOING TO CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS SUCH AS LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES NURSING HOMES. SINCE BEGINNING OUR WORK AROUND CORONAVIRUS MAINE CDC HAS FILLED 832 ORDERS FOR PPE COMPRISING THE BROADEST SWATH OF HEALTHCARE FIRST RESPONDER AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE STATE. AND I JUST LIKE TO TAKE A SECOND TO THANK THE STAFF WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND OUR PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM FOR PULLING PACKING AND SHIPPING THESE ORDERS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN KEEP FRONTLINE HEALTHCARE WORKERS IN THE JOB CARING FOR MAIN PEOPLE WHO COULD BE AT RISK FOR CORONAVIRUS. I’D LIKE TO NOW TURN THINGS OVER TO GOVERNOR MILLS FOR ANY FOR HER UPDATES. THANK YOU AS ALWAYS FOR YOUR COMPASSION AND YOUR INTELLIGENT DELIVERY AND AGGREGATION OF THE FACTS AND MEDICAL SCIENCE BECAUSE EVERYTHING WE’RE DOING EVERY STEP WE TAKE IN THE FACE OF THIS PANDEMIC IS BASED ON FACT. MEDICAL SCIENCE AND THE EXPERTS WHEN WE’VE BROUGHT TOGETHER INCLUDING DR. SHAW OF COURSE AND OUR COMMISSIONER OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. YOU KNOW, I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK ALL THE PEOPLE OF MAINE. WE GO BACK A LONG WAYS. YOU AND I AND FOR GENERATIONS RESILIENCE HAS DEFINED THE CHARACTER OF THE MAIN PEOPLE NEWCOMERS AND OLD TIMERS ALIKE. NOT THAT I REMEMBER THIS EVENT, BUT MY PARENTS WOULD TELL ME ABOUT HOW IN MARCH OF 1936 THE YEAR OF THE GREAT FLOOD. HEAVY SNOW AND RAIN OVERFLOW THE ANDROSCOGGIN RIVER. WIPING OUT ROADS RUINING BUSINESSES DESTROYING HOMES ALL OVER AND MAIN PEOPLE PADDLING CANOES AND BOATS AND DOWN THESE SUBMERGED STREETS EVACUATING STRANDED NEIGHBORS TAKING THEM TO HIGHER GROUND. IN OCTOBER 1947 THE YEAR MEAN BURNED IS IT WAS CALLED? FIRES RAGE THROUGH A QUARTER MILLION ACRES OF OUR FORESTS THEY RAISED NINE TOWNS. AND LEFT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOMELESS. WHEN FIRES BLOCKED THE ROADS MAINE FISHERMAN EVACUATED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE OUT TO SEA BY SEA TO A NEIGHBORING VILLAGE. AND THEN IN JANUARY 1998 SOMETHING MOST OF US OF US REMEMBER. THE ICE STORM THE SURPRISE ICE STORM PLUNGED A HALF A MILLION MAIN PEOPLE INTO DARKNESS IN TOO COLD FOR WEEKS AT A TIME. AMANE LYMAN WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO RESTORE POWER REMARKED IN A NEWSPAPER QUOTE PEOPLE WERE INCREDIBLE. IT’S DIFFERENT IN MAINE THAN IT IS. PROBABLY ANYWHERE ELSE. PEOPLE ARE RESILIENT THEY PULLED TOGETHER. THE LINEMAN SAID SO TIME AND TIME AGAIN MAIN PEOPLE HAVE RISEN TO THE CHALLENGES THAT CONFRONT US. WE HAVE SURVIVED FIRE AND FLOOD ICE STORMS AND MOST RECENTLY APRIL SNOW AND RAIN AND HEAVY WINDS. AND POWER OUTAGES FACED WITH THIS NEW CHALLENGE OF COVID-19 MAIN PEOPLE ARE ONCE AGAIN PULLING TOGETHER EVEN AS WE STAY APART. RETIRED TEACHERS IN PORTLAND ARE SHOWING MASKS FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS ON THE FRONT LINES. YARMOUTH CREATED A COMMUNITY CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE AND THEY ESTABLISHED A CALL CENTER FOR RESIDENCE. THEY ARRANGED FOR GROCERY PICKUP AND DELIVERY FOR THOSE PEOPLE CANNOT GET TO THE STORE. THE CREATED A NETWORK WHERE VOLUNTEERS CAN KEEP TABS ON OTHER PEOPLE IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. MONMOUTH ACADEMY THE TRACK AND FIELD COACH HAS A DELIVERING BAG BACK BREAKFASTS AND LUNCHES TO MAKE SURE THE KIDS ARE FED. PINELAND FARMS POTATO COMPANY IS GIVING OUT 5050 BOXES OF FOOD ACROSS THE COUNTY. AND LL BEAN AN ORIGIN AND NEW BALANCE ARE SEWING MASK TURNING TO AND PROVIDING SOME OF THAT PPE TO PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE. AND JUST THE OTHER DAY PENDER MAKING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OUR COMMISSIONER. GAVE OUT 500 IPADS LAPTOPS HOT SPOTS TWO KIDS AND PISCATAQUA EAST COUNTY SO THAT THEY CAN BE PART OF THE COMMUNITY AGAIN SO THAT THEY’LL STAY CONNECTED. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO LEARN AND BE ABLE TO SPEAK WITH THEIR FRIENDS OVER THE INTERNET AND WE’RE DOING THE SAME IN WALDO COUNTY AND OTHER COUNTIES TO COME THANKS TO THE GENEROSITY OF MAINE. DONORS AND TO THE HARD WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE. THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE WAYS THAT MAIN PEOPLE HAVE STOOD UP STEPPED UP JUST AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST. WE’RE ROLLING EACH OTHER ASHORE. KEEPING OURSELVES FROM DROWNING. THESE ARE MORE THAN RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS. THEY ARE LIFELINES COMMUNITY LIFELINES LIFELINES FOR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. I KNOW THERE WILL BE DIFFICULT DAYS AHEAD STILL. DAYS AND WEEKS BEFORE US BUT I’M CONFIDENT. WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH THIS CHALLENGE WITH TOUGHNESS AND RESILIENCE AND INGENUITY. AND WE CANNOT LET DOWN OUR GUARD. THAT IS WHY TODAY? I SIGNED A PROCLAMATION EXTENDING MAINS CIVIL STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR ANOTHER 30 DAYS. THROUGH MAY 15TH 2020 THE ORIGINAL STATE OF EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION WOULD HAVE EXPIRED TOMORROW. THIS MEANS I RETAIN THE EMERGENCY POWERS. DOESN’T MEAN THAT EVERY SINGLE EMERGENCY ORDER WILL NECESSARILY STAY IN EFFECT. WE’LL HAVE THE POWER TO REMAIN AS LONG AS THEY ARE NECESSARY THROUGH THROUGH THE NEXT 30 DAYS. I SURE WISH THAT THIS PROCLAMATION WERE NOT NECESSARY. BUT THE CONTINUED SPREAD OF THIS DEADLY VIRUS DEMANDS OUR SUSTAINED RESPONSE. A STATE OF CIVIL EMERGENCY CONTINUING STATE OF CIVIL EMERGENCY KEEPS MAIN ON HIGH ALERT AND ALLOWS ME TO DEPLOY ALL AVAILABLE STATE RESOURCES TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF MAINE PEOPLE AND TO SWIFTLY RESPOND TO AND PROTECT AGAINST THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 IN MAINE IT ALSO EASES MAINS ACCESS TO CRITICAL FEDERAL AID. AND FOR NOW CONTINUE TO URGE MET PEOPLE TO DO THEIR PART AND STAY APART. IT IS THE BEST WAY AND THE ONLY WAY WE WILL DEFEAT THIS VIRUS AND PROTECT THE STATE THAT WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE. SO STAY THE COURSE FOLKS STICK WITH US HERE. YOU’RE SAVING LIVES HUNDREDS OF LIES BY STAYING HOME. AND I KNOW IT’S A TEST OF PATIENCE. BUT DON’T FORGET TO HUG YOUR KIDS. TELL HIM TO KEEP A JOURNAL MAYBE WRITE DOWN THEIR THOUGHTS DURING THE DAY AND THE EVENING BEFORE THEY GO TO BED. KEEP THOSE THOUGHTS SO THAT YEARS LATER THEY LOOK BACK AND THEY’LL SAY THAT’S HOW I FELT. I REMEMBER NOW FEELING THAT WAY. THEY’LL KNOW HOW THEY GREW HOW THEY LEARNED. AND HOW LUCKY THEY WERE. TO LIVE IN THE GREAT STATE OF MAINE BE PATIENT WITH YOUR KIDS. PATIENT WITH YOUR PARTNER YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS. BE PATIENT WITH YOUR NEIGHBORS. BE PATIENT WITH YOURSELF. GIVE YOURSELF A HUG ONCE IN A WHILE. I REMEMBER WE ARE ALL WORKING. DAY AND NIGHT TO KEEP YOU SAFE EVERY HOUR EVERY DAY. GOD BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU SAFE. GOD BLESS BLESS THE STATE OF MAINE. I BELIEVE WE HAVE. THANK YOU, GOVERNOR. YES, WE’VE GOT SOME QUESTIONS FROM OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE MEDIA AND WE’LL START WITH STEVE BETS FROM THE COURIER GAZETTE. GO AHEAD STEVE. YES, THANK YOU. DOCTOR. THIS QUESTION IS FOR GOVERNOR MILLS YES, YESTERDAY YESTERDAY PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DECIDE WHEN STATES CAN EASE RESTRICTIONS. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT? AND WILL YOU BE WORKING WITH OTHER GOVERNORS IN THE REGION DECIDE WHEN MAIN WE OPEN? THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION STEVE. HE ASKED I GUESS I CAN HEAR IT BUT HE ASKS ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP STATEMENT LAST NIGHT. IT’S HARD FOR ME TO KEEP ON TOP OF ALL THE STATEMENTS COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, AND I DON’T WRITE THEM DOWN. I DON’T RESPOND TO THEM. I THINK IT’S NECESSARY FOR ME TO RESPOND TO THEM. I AM WORKING WITH OTHER GOVERNORS. I WAS ON A CALL FOR AN HOUR-AND-A-HALF YESTERDAY WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT AND WITH DR. BURKE. FEMA DIRECTOR GAINER AND OTHERS AND 50 GOVERNORS WE HAD A WE HAD A VIGOROUS CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE CAN KEEP WORKING TOGETHER HOW WE CAN ACCESS MORE TEST MATERIALS AND TEST KITS HOW WE CAN DISTRIBUTE PPE AND GET AS MUCH AS WE CAN HOW WE CAN DEAL WITH NURSING HOME. AM I GOING TOO FAST? WE NURSING HOME IN. GET LIVING. SITUATIONS AND WE’RE WORKING TOGETHER AS A TEAM. I KNOW I’VE BEEN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE GOVERNORS OF VERMONT AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. BECAUSE THEY’RE ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL WE R / KAPPA TURN IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER CASES NUMBER OF DEATHS. HELLO, VERMONT IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THEIR POPULATION. WE’RE TALKING WE ALL HAVE THE SAME KINDS OF EMERGENCY ORDERS IN EFFECT. FACT FROM ON HASHE DOES THAT ALS STAY AT HOME ORDER. AND THEN FOR DR. SHAW, I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION IF I COULD. THANK YOU. AMY. THE STAY-AT-HOME ORDER WAS ALREADY EXTENDED A BLEEP TILL THE END OF THIS MONTH. AND IT IS SUBJECT SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND RENEWAL IF APPROPRIATE. TILL MAY 15TH ALONG WITH THE CIVIL EMERGENCY NOT YET THE POWER TO EXTEND IT IS EXTENDED. AND I’LL GO AHEAD WITH YOUR FOLLOW UP AMY. OKAY. IT’S ABOUT ASYMPTOMATIC PEOPLE WHO HAVE TESTED POSITIVE. WE’LL ALL OF THOSE FOLKS HAVE BEEN TRULY DEVELOP THE COVID-19 ILLNESS AND IF NOT, CAN THEY CONTINUE TO SPREAD IT WHILE THEY’RE ASYMPTOMATIC OR DO THEY EVENTUALLY DEVELOP ANTIBODIES? HOW DOES THAT WORK? OKAY, SO GREAT QUESTIONS. AMY AMY’S QUESTION IS ABOUT ASYMPTOMATIC PEOPLE AND WHETHER THEY GO ON TO DEVELOP FULL-BLOWN COVID-19. AND AMY, IT’S A GREAT QUESTION AND THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES HERE. WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND. ONE CATEGORY IS ASYMPTOMATIC. THAT MEANS PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE THE DISEASE AND NEVER SHOW ANY SYMPTOMS. THE OTHER CATEGORY WHICH IS SIMILAR, BUT DIFFERENT ARE PRE-SYMPTOMATIC PEOPLE. PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE VIRUS BUT JUST HAVEN’T YET DEVELOP SYMPTOMS. THERE’S A LOT OF RESEARCH THAT’S GOING ON RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF EVERYONE WHO GETS EXPOSED TO THE VIRUS IS COMPLETELY ASYMPTOMATIC VERSUS PRE-SYMPTOMATIC THE BEST DATED. WE HAVE COMES FROM A SOMEWHAT GRUESOME SOURCE, WHICH IS SOME OF THE CRUISE SHIPS THAT HAVE THAT WE’VE SEEN IN THE NEWS AROUND THE WORLD WERE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE DEVELOPED THE DISEASE AND SOME OF THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE ON THOSE CRUISE SHIP SUGGEST THAT IN SOME CASES ABOUT ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE. GET WHO HAVE COVID VIRUS IN THERE. DON’T DEVELOP SYMPTOMS AND THAT ANOTHER 20 OR 30% CAN GET GET A TESTED EARLY, BUT THEN LATER GO. ON TO DEVELOP SYMPTOMS. SO AMY THE CRITICAL THING THERE IS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ASYMPTOMATIC AND PRE-SYMPTOMATIC SIMILAR SOUNDING BUT IN TERMS OF THE SCIENCE AS CAN SEE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT. AND THEN IN ALL CASES BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE SCIENCE AMY. IS THAT EACH OF THOSE CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS SHOULD GO ON TO DEVELOP PROTECTIVE ANTIBODIES, BUT THERE’S A LOT MORE SCIENCE. ANSWERED RESEARCH GOING ON ABOUT WHEN THAT HAPPENS. I CAN YOU HEAR ME? HI, SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS A FOLLOW-UP FOR GOVERNOR. YOU JUST SAID THAT YOU SPOKE WITH OTHER YOU HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH OTHER GOVERNORS TO DISCUSS THE REOPENING OF THE ECONOMY. WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THIS PLANNING? AND WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO COME? AND MY QUESTION IS FOR DR. SHAW THE I JAMIE MODEL PREDICTED THAT TODAY IS THE PEAK FOR HOSPITAL RESOURCE USERS ME. DO YOU AGREE THAT THE PEAK IN TERMS OF OUR HOSPITAL RESOURCES AND WHAT IF THAT IF THAT IS THE CASE? WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE THAT’S A GOOD QUESTION SORT OF LEADS BACK TO THE FIRST BECAUSE WHAT WE DO IN TERMS OF TURNING THE ECONOMY SORT OF BACK ON LIKE NOT LIKE A SPIGOT BUT AS DR. CHARLES LISA SAY GOING BACK DOWN STAIRS GOING UP STAIRS SLOWLY GRADUALLY TAKING ONE STEP AT A TIME DEPENDS ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRITERIA DEPENDS ON MEDICAL SCIENCE. HOW SOON WILL IT BE BEFORE WE LIFT THE STAY-AT-HOME ORDER? HOW SOON WILL IT BE BEFORE WE ALLOW CERTAIN BUSINESSES TO ORDER TO OPEN RATHER WHAT TO OPEN MORE WIDELY? THAT IS REALLY IT’S THE QUESTION OF THE HOUR AND I CANNOT ANSWER IT BECAUSE WE’RE TAKING IT DAY BY DAY HOUR BY HOUR AND THAT’S WHAT ALL THE GOVERNORS IN OUR AREA ARE DOING. WE’RE TALKING A LOT. WE’RE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT CONSTRUCTION CAN BEGIN AGAIN IN VERMONT, ALTHOUGH WE’VE LOUD LOUD CONSTRUCTION TO CONTINUE IN MAINE. WE’RE TALKING ABOUT HOW CREWS CAN WORK TOGETHER. WHAT BEST PRACTICES WE SHOULD RECOMMEND OR IMPOSE WHEN CERTAIN BUSINESSES DO REOPEN BECAUSE NO ABOUT IT. WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO KEEP IN PLACE SOME PHYSICAL DISTANCING LIMITATIONS REQUIREMENTS AND SOME OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY MADE PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES. SO WE’RE TAKING IT ONE DAY AT A TIME. I’M SORRY. I DON’T HAVE A MORE JUST MORE DEFINITE ANSWER FOR YOU A LOT DEPENDS AGAIN ON TESTING AS WELL. THE MORE TEST KITS WE GET THE BETTER ABLE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO BETTER ABLE WE WILL BE TO ALLOW MORE PEOPLE TO GO BACK TO DIFFERENT AREAS. SO HE SAYS TO THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION, I’LL START AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO COMMISSIONER LAMB BREW FOR THE ACS. PEACE, BUT IT SPEAKS TO ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WHEN WE DO OUR MODELING, WE DON’T RELY SOLELY UPON ANY ONE TYPE OF MODEL THE I HME MODEL IS JUST ONE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MODELS OUT THERE. IT’S CLOSELY AKIN TO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE WEATHER TOMORROW WILL BE LIKE BY PULLING THE ALMANAC OFF THE SHELF AND SEEING WHAT THE WEATHER WAS LIKE LAST YEAR. IT’S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW AT ANY ONE TIME WHETHER WE ARE AT THE PEAK. THE FOCUS OF OUR MODELING WORK THE REASON WE DO MODELING IS NOT TO PREDICT WHEN WE MIGHT BE AT THE BEAK BUT TO PLAN FOR WHAT RESOURCES WE MIGHT NEED WHENEVER THAT PEAK HAPPENS, WHATEVER IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE WE MAY NOT KNOW FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SEVERAL MONTHS WEATHER TODAY WAS THE PEAK OR WAS NOT THE PEAK IN ANY OUTBREAK. YOU REALLY ONLY KNOW THAT IN RETROSPECT. WHAT I CAN TELL YOU, IS THAT NO MATTER WHICH SCENARIO WE HAPPEN TO FIND OURSELVES IN. WE AT THE STATE OF MAINE ARE READY FOR THAT FROM A RESOURCE PERSPECTIVE ONE OF THOSE RESOURCE PERSPECTIVES IS THE ALTERNATIVE CARE SITES. I’LL TURN THAT OVER TO COMMISSIONER LAMBERT. AS WE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COUNTY OF CUMBERLAND CITY OF PORTLAND AND THE CITY OF BANGOR AS WELL AS PENOBSCOT COUNTY ON TO ALTERNATIVE CARE IN THOSE LOCATIONS. WE HAVE SINCE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT IDENTIFIED USES FOR THOSE SITES IN THE PORTLAND AREA. IT WOULD BE FOR PEOPLE WITH COVID-19 WHO DON’T REQUIRE INTENSE CARE POST-ACUTE CARE. PLEASE PEOPLE WHO CAN’T GO HOME WHO CAN’T FIND A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PLACEMENT. IN BANGOR, IT WOULD BE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE COVID-19 PEOPLE WHO YOU WANT TO KEEP OUT OF A HEALTH CARE SETTING TO AVOID ANY POTENTIAL INFECTION. SO WE’VE IDENTIFIED THE USES. WE’VE ALSO BEGUN TO DEPLOY BEDS. SO WE HAVE MOVED A HUNDRED BEDS TO THE PORTLAND AREA. WE ARE STAGING THOSE BEDS. THERE WILL BE AT LEAST 50 BEDS IN THE BANGOR AREA AND WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO FINALIZING STAFFING PLANS. THAT SAID AS DR. SHAW SAID EARLIER AS OF TODAY, THERE ARE 21 PEOPLE IN CRITICAL CARE BEDS IN THE STATE OF MAINE. OUR 58 PEOPLE TOTAL HOSPITALIZED THE STATE OF MAINE? AND WHEN WE DO OUR DAILY CHECK ON RESOURCE AVAILABILITY. YOU HAVE A HUNDRED SIXTY THREE CRITICAL CARE BEDS AVAILABLE. WE ALSO HAVE OVER 200 283 VENTILATORS AVAILABLE AGAIN NINE PEOPLE ARE USING VENTILATORS TODAY FOR COVID-19 CONFIRMED CASES AND WE HAVE 283 AVAILABLE. WE PREFER TO T CARE FOR PEOPLE IN HOSPITALS. WE HAVE HIGH QUALITY HOSPITAL STAFF HIGH-QUALITY HOSPITALS. AND OUR GOAL IS KEEP PEOPLE IN HOSPITALS. WHEREVER POSSIBLE WE WOULD ONLY GO TO ALTERNATIVE CARE SITES SHOULD WE NEED TO BUT AT THIS MOMENT WE DON’T THINK WE NEED TO STAND THEM UP THIS WEEK. SO WE CONTINUE TO PLAY THEM. WE WILL GET THOSE PLANS REFINED AND READY TO GO BUT AT THIS MOMENT WE SEE NO NEED FOR THEM TODAY. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER AND WE WILL TURN NEXT TO MEGAN FROM WMTW. MY QUESTION IS FOR YOU. DR. SHAH. DO YOU KEEP TRACK OF SUSPECTED COVID-19 CASES, PERHAPS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVEN’T BEEN ABLE TO GET TESTED OR THEIR PHYSICIAN HAS SAID NO, YOU KNOW, WE CAN’T WE DON’T WANT TO TEST YOU GO HOME AND QUARANTINE. BECAUSE WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW THAT THERE ARE MORE CASES OUT THERE. WE JUST YOU KNOW, HAVEN’T HAD THEM QUOTE UNQUOTE CONFIRMED. DO YOU KEEP TRACK OF THOSE? SO MEGAN’S QUESTION IS ABOUT IN AN OUTBREAK SETTING. HOW DO WE KNOW HOW LARGE THE ICEBERG TOTALLY IS? AND WHAT DO WE DO IN TERMS OF REPORTING AND KEEPING TRACK? SO TWO OBSERVATIONS THERE MEGAN THE FIRST IS THAT ONE OF THE PIECES OF DATA THAT WE ASKED HOSPITALS TO REPORT. ARE NOT JUST THE NUMBER OF CONFIRMED PATIENTS WITH COVID-19. BUT ALSO THOSE THAT THE HOSPITAL SUSPECT STEW HAVE COVID-19. I DON’T REPORT THOSE NUMBERS OUT EVERY DAY BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT TO BE A LOT OF NUMBERS ALL AT ONCE BUT WE HAVE THOSE NUMBERS WE CAN GET YOU TODAY’S NUMBERS FOR EXAMPLE, SO WE DO ASK HOSPITALS TO REPORT THAT TO US BASED ON THEIR CLINICAL SUSPICION. WE ALSO HOWEVER KNOW THAT AT LEAST THREE COUNTIES IN MAINE COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION IS OCCURRING. FIRST IN CUMBERLAND THEN YORK NOW PENOBSCOT COUNTIES AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT COVID-19 IS AKIN TO THE FLU. IT’S ALL AROUND US. IT’S EVERYWHERE NOT JUST IN PARTICULAR ZONES. WHAT THAT ALSO MEANS IS THAT SOME CLINICIANS MAY NOT TAKE THE STEP. THEY MAY DECIDE THAT YOU KNOW, WE’RE NOT SURE WHETHER THE RESPIRATORY ILLNESS YOU HAVE IS THE FLU ANOTHER VIRUS OR COVID VIRUS. WE’RE JUST GOING TO TREAT YOU AS IF IT WERE ONE OF THOSE THREE AND ASK YOU TO STAY HOME AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. IN THOSE IN THOSE SITUATIONS CLINICIANS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT THAT AS A COVID-19 CASE TO THE MAINE CDC. THEY ARE CERTAINLY ALLOWED TO BUT WHAT WE REQUIRE REPORTING OF OUR LABORATORY CONFIRMED CASES SO THAT WE DON’T HAVE THAT CONFUSION ABOUT WHETHER ANY CASE WAS INFLUENZA COVID OR ANOTHER VIRUS. THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION, AND WE WILL TURN NEXT TO DAN NEWMAN AT THE MAIN BEACON. HELLO. YEAH, I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR DR. SHAW AND ONE FOR GOVERNOR OF MEALS IF YOU’LL ALLOW ME. DR. SHAW UNDERSTAND. THERE’S AN ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT UNIVERSAL TESTING IN NURSING HOMES WITHOUT ALSO BE HELPFUL AT IN PRISONS AND JAILS WHERE PEOPLE ARE ALSO BEING HELD IN CONGREGATE LIVING. CAN YOU SAY MORE ABOUT GENERALLY ABOUT WHAT TESTING REGIMEN THERE IS FOR PEOPLE IN CONFINEMENT IN MAINE MAINE APPEARS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, AS ONLY TEST 17 IN MADE SO FAR. SECONDLY GOVERNOR MILLS. ARE THERE ANY POLICIES BEING ADVANCED TO MOVE MORE PEOPLE TO COMMUNITY CONFINEMENT OR THE PRISON POPULATION? I’LL START THE FIRST PIECE GOVERNOR IF THAT’S ALL RIGHT. SO DAN, YOU ARE CORRECT THAT BASED ON OUR MORNING BRIEFING WERE AWARE OF SEVENTEEN INDIVIDUALS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS WHO HAVE ALL TESTED NEGATIVE FOR COVID-19 NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE EXACT PROTOCOLS THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND THEIR MEDICAL PROVIDERS FOLLOW I WOULD REFER YOU TO CORRECTIONS JUST SO I DON’T GET ANY OF THE FACTS WRONG, BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THEY FOLLOW THE U.S. CDC’S GUIDELINES WITH RESPECT TO WHOM TO BUT FOR THE SPECIFIC NUANCES AGAIN IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE I DON’T GIVE YOU ANYTHING INCORRECT. I WOULD I WOULD REFER YOU TO CORRECTIONS AND THEN AS TO THE LATTER QUESTION GOVERNOR MILLS SEE YEP. THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS HAS BEEN ASSESSING A LOT OF DIFFERENT INMATES IN THE STATE FACILITIES. THEY HAVE RELEASED. I BELIEVE LAST COUNT 63 PEOPLE OUT OF THE STATE FACILITIES INTO WHAT’S CALLED SUPERVISED COMMUNITY CONFINEMENT. THAT IS THEY HAVE A PLACE TO GO TO A PLACE TO STAY BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THIS STAY-AT-HOME ORDER BEYOND THAT. I HAVE NOT I AM NOT ISSUING COMMUTATIONS WIDELY OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT AND TAKING IT STEP BY STEP. WE THE DEPARTMENT IS BASING HIS DECISIONS ON WHO’S ELIGIBLE FOR SUPERVISED COMMUNITY CONFINEMENT BASED ON RISK TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST AND FOREMOST AND LENGTH OF TERM LENGTH OF TIME LEFT ON THE PERSON SENTENCE THOSE TWO THINGS HAVE BEEN THE PRIMARY CRITERIA FOR THOSE RELEASE DECISIONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION WILL TURN NEXT TO DON KERRIGAN AT NEWSCENTER. GO AHEAD DON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DR. COUPLE OF QUESTIONS REGARDING LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES. FIRST OF ALL, I BELIEVE THE THRESHOLD FOR TESTING PEOPLE IN ONE OF THOSE FACILITIES REQUIRING EVERYBODY TO BE TESTED IS THREE CASES TO MAKE AN OUTBREAK. ARE YOU LOOKING AT REDUCING THAT THRESHOLD AND TESTING OWN PLACE IF EVEN ONE CASE HOW RAPIDLY CASE IT’S HAVE SPREAD IN THESE THREE HOMES, AND SECONDLY, ARE YOU ANYWHERE NEAR A SITUATION WHERE YOU MIGHT NEED TO FIND OTHER PLACES TO MOVE HEALTHY NURSING HOME PATIENTS IF THE OUTBREAKS GET TOO BIG GREAT. THANKS FOR THOSE QUESTIONS DONE DONE. YOUR FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT HOW WE THINK ABOUT TESTING IN CARE FACILITIES NURSING HOMES. IT’S IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN TOP OF MIND FOR US FOR QUITE SOME TIME. I’M AND MORE INTENSIVELY JUST IN THE LAST WEEK OR TWO AS WE’VE BEEN THINKING AND REVIEWING DATA FROM OTHER STATES ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT I’M PROUD OF IS MAIN WAS REALLY JUST BASED. A CALL I HAD LAST NIGHT WITH MY COUNTERPARTS FROM THE OTHER 49 STATES MAIN REALLY IS ONE OF THE FEW STATES THAT IS ALREADY. INSTITUTED A POLICY OF UNIVERSAL TESTING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THERE ARE OTHER STATES THAT ARE CONTEMPLATING HOW AND WHEN TO FOLLOW THE LEAD THAT MAIN IS ALREADY TAKEN AND I ANTICIPATE OTHER STATES WILL DO SO BUT AS I WAS CHATTING WITH MY COLLEAGUES LAST NIGHT AND TALKING ABOUT HOW WE’VE ALREADY MOVED TOWARD UNIVERSAL TESTING NOW AND THREE FACILITIES THAT WAS NEWS TO THEM. AND SO IT’S SOMETHING THAT WE’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF THE DATA. THE APPROACH THAT WE’VE TAKEN AS A STARTING POINT. IS WHEN THERE IS AN OUTBREAK. AN OUTBREAK IS DEFINED BY ANY THREE INDIVIDUALS BE THEY STAFF OR RESIDENTS WHO ARE EPIDEMIOLOGICALLY CONNECTED IN SOME WAY IN THIS CASE BECAUSE THEY ARE EITHER STAFF OR RESIDENTS OF THE FACILITY. THAT’S WHERE WE STARTED THE CONVERSATION, BUT IT MAY NOT BE WHERE WE ENDED. THE REASON WE STARTED THERE, IS THAT ALTHOUGH WE ARE AWARE OF AT LEAST RIGHT NOW THREE FACILITIES IN MAINE WHERE THERE ARE OUTBREAKS AND ALTHOUGH WE ANTICIPATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF MORE. WE’RE SIMILARLY AWARE OF OTHER FACILITIES WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN ONE CASE THAT DID NOT FLARE UP INTO AN OUTBREAK. AND THAT’S A GOOD THING. IT’S A TESTAMENT TO THE FACT THAT RAPID INTENSIVE INFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES CAN PREVENT ONE CASE INTO TURNING INTO MORE CASES. SO THE QUESTION FOR US IS HOW DO WE SQUARE THOSE TWO THINGS? AND WE RUN WE’RE ACTIVELY REVIEWING IN FACT JUST THIS MORNING. I HAD A PRETTY LONG AND INTENSE CALL WITH OUR TOP TWO MEDICAL EPIDEMIOLOGIST AT MAINE CDC TO DEBATE HOW AND WHEN AND WHETHER WE SHOULD MOVE OUR THRESHOLD FROM THREE TO ONE. RECOGNIZING DON THAT THE TIME BETWEEN ONE AND THREE MAY NOT BE THAT LONG AND SO IN PRACTICE, WE’RE NOT TALKING WEEKS AND WEEKS, BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT WE ALSO HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF TESTING SUPPLIES. SO WE’VE GOT TO BALANCE ALL OF THOSE THINGS ALL AT ONCE AS I’VE SAID BEFORE OUR DECISION ON THIS WILL BE MOTIVATED BY THREE THINGS ONE IS MAKING SURE WE DO WHAT’S BEST FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO LIVE IN AND WORK IN THESE FACILITIES NUMBER TWO SCIENCE. WHAT DO THE DATA TELL US ABOUT HOW TRANSMISSIBLE THIS VIRUSES ACROSS FACILITIES AND NUMBER THREE TRANSPARENCY. WE WANT TO BE CLEAR WITH EVERYBODY ABOUT WHAT OUR STANDARDS ARE. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THIS NO, FINAL DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AND WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE IT BECAUSE THAT’S HOW WE DO THINGS IN A SCIENTIFIC FASHION. THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION DONE, AND WE’LL TURN NEXT TO STEVE MISSLER FROM MAINE PUBLIC. THANK YOU. DR. SHAH AND GOVERNOR MILLS QUICK CLARIFICATION FOR THE GOVERNOR JUST ON THE CONVERSATION. SHE’S BEEN HAVING WITH THE GOVERNOR’S FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE AND VERMONT. THIS IS SEPARATE FROM THE CONSORTIUM THAT GOVERNOR CUOMO HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT OR IS IT SORT OF PART OF THAT INITIATIVE AND THEN A QUESTION FOR DR. SHAW IS ABOUT YESTERDAY. DR. BURKE’S MENTIONED. I THINK DURING THE WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING THAT THEY ARE. ARE THE FEDS ARE LOOKING FOR SORT OF AN INVENTORY OR CENSUS OF TESTING EQUIPMENT INCLUDING ABBOTT TESTING EQUIPMENT. NOT THE NEW RAPID TESTING, BUT THE ROCHE AND ABBOTT PLATFORMS THAT CAN DO ACTUALLY MORE TESTING. MAYBE NOT QUITE AS FAST. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS FOR DR. SHAW IS WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE PARTICIPATING IN THAT INVENTORY AND IF WE IF WE ARE IF YOU COULD GIVE PROVIDE US SOME NUMBERS ABOUT WHAT THE STATE. CASSIDY IS ON THOSE PLATFORMS. IT’S ONE OF MANY MANY MANY THINGS ONE OF MANY DATA POINTS THAT THE FEDS ARE ASKING FOR US DAILY. I MIGHT SUGGEST SAY ON YOUR FIRST QUESTION STEVE. THE CONVERSATIONS I’M HAVING WITH THE GOVERNORS OF VERMONT AND NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE SEPARATE FROM WHAT NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, CONNECTICUT, RHODE ISLAND, I GUESS MASSACHUSETTS ARE DOING AND WHAT THE WEST COAST STATES ARE DOING, OREGON, CALIFORNIA, WASHINGTON, I GUESS, YOU KNOW, I THINK WE HAVE A MORE SHARED ENVIRONMENT AND A SHARED ECONOMY. WE SHARE A LOT MORE THINGS CULTURALLY AND ECONOMICALLY THEN WITH THOSE TWO STATES THAN WE DO WITH THE OTHER STATES THAT YOU’VE ASKED ABOUT. WE HAVE RURAL ECONOMIES. WE HAVE DISPERSED POPULATIONS. WE HAVE A TOURISM ECONOMY AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT WE KNOW WE NEED TO REJUVENATE WE KNEW NO WE NEED TO GET BACK INTO THE INTO THE GAME IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN TRYING TO TURN THE SPIGOT BACK ON A NEW YORK CITY OR PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND, OR EVERY CONNECTICUT QUITE DIFFERENT SO BUT AT THE SAME TIME ALL 50 GOVERNORS ARE TALKING WE HAVE BY CALLS TWICE A WEEK. ONCE WITH ALL THE GOVERNOR’S JUST THE GOVERNOR’S AND A VERY FRANK CANDID CONVERSATION AMONG US, BUT WHAT WE ARE DOING SHARING INFORMATION AND PRACTICES AND WHAT WE’D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO. AND THEN SECONDLY WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT SOMETIMES JOINED BY THE PRESIDENT THAT CONVERSATION OCCURRED YESTERDAY FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF. STEVE IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION. WE ARE AWARE OF THE REQUEST FROM DR. BURKE’S IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO HELP GET A BETTER SENSE IN THE INVENTORY. THEY’RE REQUESTING INFORMATION ON TO PARTICULAR PIECES OF ROSH DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT THE 8800 AND THE 8600. SO WE ARE PARTICIPATING IN THOSE SURVEYS FOR THEM AND WHEN GETTING THEM THE DATA, WE’VE GOT WE CAN GET YOU THE EXACT NUMBERS OF WHAT WE’VE GOT HERE IN MAINE, BUT WE ARE PARTICIPATING WERE AWARE OF THAT REQUEST. UP BEFORE I GO TO THE NEXT QUESTION. I WAS I’D LIKE TO GO BACK TO DON KERRIGAN’S QUESTION JUST FOR A MOMENT. THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT PIECES ABOUT OUR RESPONSE TO FACILITIES WHEN WE ARE AWARE OF A CASE. SO WE DON YOU ASKED ABOUT TESTING, BUT I SHOULD MAKE VERY CLEAR WHAT MAINE CDC STAFF DO AND HOW THEY JUMP INTO ACTION AS SOON AS WE GET NOTIFIED OF A SINGLE CASE AT A FACILITY. SO AS SOON AS MAINE CDC IS NOTIFIED OF A SINGLE CASE AT A FACILITY OF ANY TYPE OF CONGREGATE LIVING. WE THEY IMMEDIATELY ROCKET TO THE TOP OF OUR LIST FOR ANY PPE NEEDS. WE ALSO PUT THEM IN TOUCH WITH NECESSARY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCES FROM AN INFECTION CONTROL. GENEALOGY, AND IF NEEDED PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING PERSPECTIVE TO HELP THEM UTILIZE THAT PPE TO HELP THEM COHORT PATIENTS AND HELP THEM. KEEP TRACK OF ANY NEW ILLNESS THAT HAPPENS AS SOON AS WE DETECT EVEN A SINGLE CASE SO WE DON’T WAIT FOR 3 FOR THOSE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT TECHNICAL PIECES, AND THAT’S ONE REASON WE’VE HAD A LOT OF FACILITIES IN MAINE WHO HAVE HAD ONE CASE AND NO MORE THAN THAT. AND STEVE WILL GET YOU THE DATA WITH RESPECT TO THE ROCHE 86 AND 88 HUNDREDS. I’D LIKE TO TURN NEXT TO TJ TREMBLE FROM WVI. GO AHEAD TJ. THE GOVERNOR MILLS GOVERNOR. HOW ARE YOU? GOOD. THANK YOU. WHAT ARE THE BENCHMARKS IF ANY THAT WOULD MOVE YOU TO LIFT THE STAY AT HOME THIS POINT? THAT WOULD BE AGAIN BASED ON PUBLIC HEALTH DATA AND THE ADVICE OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS INCLUDING DR. SHAW AND ARE VARIOUS COMMISSIONERS INCLUDING COMMISSIONER LAMBREAUX WHO’S HERE TODAY. IT WOULD NOT SIMPLY BE BASED ON. THE TIME OF DAY THE TIME OF MONTH. THE TIME WHEN WE USUALLY OPEN THIS OR USUALLY OPEN THAT IT WILL BE BASED SOLELY. ON WHEN IS IT SAFE TO SAFE TO REOPEN A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY A REOPEN A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY OR AREA? WHEN IS IT SAFE TO ALLOW TO ASK PEOPLE TO COME BACK OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND TO GO TO THE THEATER AGAIN? I GO TO THE PARKS AGAIN GO TO THE BEACHES AGAIN. IT’S PURELY BASED ON. PUBLIC HEALTH CAN YOU SAY WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE THAT WILL INDICATE THAT THINGS ARE SAFE IN THE COMMUNITY AT THAT POINT AGAIN A LOT OF IT DEPENDS ON EXPANDING TESTING AS FAR AND WIDE AS WE CAN. BECAUSE TESTING WILL TELL US WHETHER THE VIRUS HAS SPREAD THE NUMBERS THE DOCTOR SHOCK. PRESENTS EVERY DAY WHEN WE SAY IT’S NEW CASES, IT’S REALLY NEW TEST RESULTS AS OPPOSED TO NEW CASES. THE CASES ARE OUT THERE. WE JUST HAVEN’T DOCUMENTED ALL OF THEM CONFIRMED. ALL OF THEM. IT IS EVERYWHERE WE HAVE TO ASSUME IT IS EVERYWHERE. SO UNTIL WE GET OVER THAT HUGE HUMP OF KNOWING THAT IT IS GONE THAT IT HAS SUBSIDED. AND I DON’T KNOW THE DATA POINT THAT THAT THAT THAT MAKES THAT DETERMINATION, BUT WE WILL DECIDE THAT TOGETHER. THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION. TJ. NEXT UP IS BRAD RODGER SOME WGME. YES, DR. SHAW AS YOU’VE NOTED TODAY AND YESTERDAY A LOT OF THE PPE IS GOING TO LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES AT THOSE FACILITIES. WAS THERE A SHORTAGE OF TP IT’S A THREE LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES WHERE WE HAD THE OUTBREAK. WAS THERE A SHORTAGE AND WERE THEY WEARING THE PPE THE STAFF WERE THEY WEARING THE PPE THAT THEY NECESSARY? YOU KNOW BRAD, I CANDIDLY I THINK I WOULD ASK YOU TO CHECK IN WITH THOSE THREE FACILITIES TO GET A OUR SENSE OF ANY SHORTAGES THEY WERE EXPERIENCING AS WELL AS THEIR UTILIZATION WHAT WE DO AS SOON AS WE ARE MADE AWARE OF EVEN A SINGLE CASE OF ANY KIND OF IN OF ANY TYPE OF COVID INFECTION IS WE A GO PACK. THAT’S READY TO GO THAT STARTS A FACILITY OFF WITH A MINIMUM OF 72 HOURS. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IN ANY SITUATION WHERE THERE IS A SINGLE CASE OF COVID-19 THE DEMAND FOR PPE AMONGST THE STAFF THE NEED THE USE OF PPE BY THE STAFF NEEDS TO GO UP SIGNIFICANTLY. SO WE ARE IMMEDIATELY POISED TO DISPATCH AT LEAST 72 HOURS. WHICH HAPPENS TO BE ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE AMOUNT THAT ANY FACILITY SHOULD HAVE ON HAND AT DAY ONE. AFTER THAT DISPATCH IS MADE WE START WORKING WITH THEM TO GAUGE WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS AND THAT IS OF COURSE ALWAYS IN FLUX BASED ON THE NUMBER OF STAFF A NUMBER OF RESIDENTS HOW THEY ARE ABLE TO MOVE PATIENTS INTO ONE WING SAFELY AND KEEP THEM SEPARATED FROM OTHER OTHER UNEXPOSED PATIENTS. SO IT VARIES GREATLY BY FACILITY AND IT REALLY IS A TESTAMENT TO THE WORK THAT OUR EPIDEMIOLOGISTS AND OUR INFECTION CONTROL TEAM DO BECAUSE EACH AND EVERY FACILITY IS DIFFERENT. I’D LIKE TO TURN NEXT TO KEVIN MILLAR AT THE PRESS HERALD. THANKS. DR. SHAW ONE CLARIFICATION QUESTION FIRST AND THEN OF THE BROADER QUESTION ON THE CLARIFICATION, OBVIOUSLY, WE SAW A FEW MORE TESTS FEW MORE POSITIVE CONFIRMED CASES THAT THE LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES. IS THAT BECAUSE YOU’RE DOING TESTING EVERY DAY, OR CAN YOU JUST TELL US HOW OFTEN YOU’RE DOING TESTING THAT YOU REVEAL THESE ADDITIONAL TESTS AND THEN THE BROADER QUESTION QUESTION ABOUT LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES. WHAT’S THEY HAVE YOUR GUM SHOE AT ME. I’LL JUST BEEN ABLE TO KIND OF NAIL DOWN WHERE SOME OF THESE ORIGINAL MYTH WERE THESE CASES ORIGINATED FROM YOU KNOW, FOR INSTANCE. WAS IT A CONTRACTOR COMING IN OR YOU KNOW TECHNICIAN THAT FLOATS FROM NUMEROUS DIFFERENT FACILITIES MAY HAVE BROUGHT IT IN EXPOSED PEOPLE SURE THAT THAT’S TWO GREAT QUESTIONS KEVIN AND YOU KNOW IN CONNECTION WITH THE QUESTIONS THAT BRAD RAISED A MOMENT AGO. I JUST WANT TO PAUSE VERY QUICKLY QUICKLY AND NOTE THAT WE TALK A LOT ABOUT TALK TO SILAT. HE’S IN INSTITUTIONS AND PLACES LIKE THAT. BUT I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT WHAT WE’RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT OUR HOMES FOR OUR SPOUSES OUR SIBLINGS OUR PARENTS AND THESE ARE HOMES THAT ARE STAFFED BY MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE GOING INTO AREAS. WE KNOW THAT ARE HIGHLY AFFECTED BY COVID-19 AND I JUST WANT TO THANK THEM AGAIN I ASK THAT NEXT TIME EVERYBODY CALLS THEIR MOM IF YOUR MOM HAPPENS TO LIVE IN A LONG-TERM CARE FACILITY. ASK YOUR MOM TO PASS THE PHONE TO THE CARETAKER WHO PROVIDES FOR HER CARE BECAUSE THAT PERSON KEEPS SHOWING UP FOR WORK AND I THINK WE ALL OWE THEM A THANKS KEVIN TO YOUR TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT WHERE SOME OF THESE NEW NUMBERS ARE COMING FROM WITH A LOT OF FACILITIES, ESPECIALLY THE TWO MOST RECENT ONES WITH WHOM WE’VE BEEN WORKING THE AUGUSTA CENTER FOR HEALTH AND REHABILITATION AND THE MAINE VETERANS HOME. THEY WERE TESTING STAFF AS THEY’VE COME ON SERVICE AS THEY’VE COME ON SHIFT. SO MANY OF THE NEW INCREASES THAT WE’VE SEEN THOUGH, NOT ALL BUT MANY OF THEM ARE IN STAFF MEMBERS WHO PERHAPS HADN’T WORKED FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND SHOWED UP FOR THEIR FIRST SHIFT ON SATURDAY OR SUNDAY AND GOT TESTED AND THEN THOSE THOSE THOSE TESTS GOT SHIPPED TO OUR LABORATORY IN AUGUSTA THAT ACCOUNTS FOR MANY OF THEM AGAIN, THOUGH. NOT ALL YOU’RE QUICK HAVING YOUR QUESTION, YOU KNOW, IT PRESUPPOSES SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY, WHICH IS IF WE WE DO MOVE TO UNIVERSAL TESTING. THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGING QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE THINK ABOUT FIRST BEFORE WE GO IN THAT DIRECTION RATHER THAN GO OFF HALF-COCKED AND JUST DO SOMETHING WITHOUT A FULL PLAN AND CHIEF AMONG THOSE QUESTIONS IS HOW OFTEN SHOULD WE REPEAT TESTING ON INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NEGATIVE THAT’S SOMETHING THAT MY TEAM AND I ARE THINKING ABOUT REALLY INTENSELY RIGHT NOW. AND BEFORE WE MOVE IN ANY DIRECTION AROUND THAT WE WANT TO THINK IT THROUGH TO THE END GAME AND NOT JUST MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT WITHOUT HAVING THOUGHT THROUGH THE IMPLICATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, HOW LONG AND HOW OFTEN SHOULD WE RETEST PEOPLE? KEVIN TO YOUR POINT ABOUT WHETHER OUR DISEASE DETECTIVES HAVE DETERMINED WHERE SOME OF THESE INFECTIONS INTRODUCED WE HAVEN’T FOUND THAT WE HAVEN’T FOUND THAT ENTRY ENTRY POINT QUITE YET, BUT THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THEY’RE WORKING TO PIECE TOGETHER. NEXT QUESTION GOES TO BRIAN SULLIVAN FROM WABI BRIAN. GO AHEAD. OKAY, THANK YOU. DR. SHAH AND GOVERNOR MILLS. MY QUESTION WOULD BE FIRST I BELIEVE THE INITIAL ORDER THIS ONE FOR YOU GOVERNOR THE INITIAL ORDER WHEN IT WAS PUT IN PLACE REAL ESTATE AGENTS WEREN’T ALLOWED TO OPERATE BUT THEN THEY MADE A CASE AND THEN WERE EVENTUALLY ABLE TO THEY FIND A SAFE WAY TO GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS AND WERE ABLE TO THEN CONDUCT BUSINESS. DO TAKE US THROUGH A PROCESS IN WHICH A BUSINESS THAT JUST CURRENTLY DEEMED. NON-ESSENTIAL COULD MAKE THEIR CASE AND REOPEN. WELL DISORDER STILL IN PLACE. SURE GREAT QUESTION. HOW CAN A BUSINESS THAT’S SORT OF NON-ESSENTIAL MAKE ITS CASE TO SOMEBODY IN STATE GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO DO BUSINESS IN SOME WAY THAT STILL PROTECTS THE PUBLIC AND WE’VE MADE THAT DETERMINATION IN A NUMBER OF CASES. GENERALLY BY HEATHER JOHNSON COMMISSIONER JOHNSON TAKING IN THE ISSUE OF THE COMPLAINT ANALYZING IT TALKING WITH ME AND OTHERS AND ISSUING A LETTER SAYING THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU’VE TOLD US WE THINK YOU CAN DO BUSINESS OR DO BUSINESS IN THIS WAY OR THAT WAY. WE’VE DONE THAT WITH RESPECT TO A LOT OF RETAIL OPERATIONS. AND THE THING IS LIKE, YOU KNOW IF YOU’RE AN INSURANCE AGENCY OR AN AUTO DEALER OR A LAW FIRM OR A BOOKSTORE THERE ARE WAYS TO DO BUSINESS WITHOUT INVITING THE PUBLIC INTO YOUR STORE AS YOU ALWAYS HAVE IN THE PAST. ARE WAYS TO TAKE ORDERS BY TELEPHONE THERE ARE WAYS TO TRANSACT REAL ESTATE BUSINESS REMOTELY. IT’S DIFFICULT GRANTED, BUT IT THERE IT IS POSSIBLE AND PEOPLE ARE DOING THAT. THEY’RE BEING CREATIVE AUTO DEALERS ARE ADVERTISING ON TV THAT WILL TAKE A INFORMATION BY PHONE WILL DELIVER THE VEHICLE TO YOUR HOME ALL KINDS OF THINGS. BOOK BOOK STORES ARE TAKING ORDERS BY TELEPHONE AND THEN EITHER DROPPING THEM OFF ON YOUR CURB OR LEAVING THEM AT THEIR CURVE FOR YOU TO PICK UP THINGS LIKE THAT WAYS TO STAY IN BUSINESS AND STAY ALIVE AND KEEP PEOPLE ACTIVE IN SOME OTHER WAY OTHER THAN CONGREGATING IN THE STORE KEEPING PHYSICAL DISTANCE AND WHAT AND THE LIKE SO WE GETTING WITH THESE THREE LOCATIONS THAT WE CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES HAVING SPIKES AND CASES. IS THERE ANY THOUGHT THAT THE MAKESHIFT HOSPITALS AT THE CROSS CENTER AND BANGOR OR CROSS ARENA IN PORTLAND MIGHT BECOME ACTIVATED OR A NECESSITY, YOU KNOW BRIAN AGAIN AT ALL AT ALL TIMES ALL OPTIONS REMAIN ON THE TABLE, BUT BASED ON THE NUMBERS THAT COMMISSIONER MAMBRÚ NOTED EARLIER WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IS SUCH THAT THERE IS CAPACITY WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. IN THE EXISTING NUMBER OF HOSPITAL BEDS, SO WE’RE ALWAYS LOOKING AT THESE DATA POINTS EACH AND EVERY DAY, BUT OF COURSE, WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE CONCERNED THAT MOVING INDIVIDUALS FROM THEIR HOMES TO A NEW LOCATION COULD POSE POTENTIAL RISKS AS WELL. SO WE’RE ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT THESE THINGS BUT RECOGNIZING THAT THERE’S ALREADY CAPACITY WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. OUR PREFERENCE IS TO KEEP FOLKS WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WITHIN HOSPITALS AND WITHIN THEIR HOMES, I’D LIKE TO TURN NEXT TO KATE COUGH FROM THE ELLSWORTH AMERICAN. MY FIRST QUESTION IS THE MAIN HAS THOUSANDS OF SEASONAL FARM WORKERS MANY OF WHOM LIVE IN CONGREGATE FACILITIE DURING THE GROWING SEASON. AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION IS FOR GOVERNOR KNOWS I’M WE HAVE A QUESTION THAT CAME IN FROM AN ELECTED OFFICIAL IN OUR AREA WHO IS WONDERING WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS DOING TO CONNECT WITH LOCAL CITY AND TOWN LEADERSHIP IN PLANNING AND DECISION-MAKING. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT OPENED UP THE H-2A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS AGRICULTURAL WORKERS FROM OUT OF COUNTRY TO COME HERE. AND A HELP WITH DIFFERENT CROPS THEY HAVEN’T GIVEN US ANY GUIDANCE ON THAT YET. AS FAR AS I KNOW WE WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN THEY DO IF THEY DO. SECONDLY, I’VE HAD SEVERAL CALLS WITH MAYORS OF THE CITIES ACROSS THE STATE HAD ONE LAST LAST WEEK. THE MAYOR’S COALITION AND I’VE HAD WELL ACTUALLY TWO CALLS WITH MUNICIPAL OFFICIALS SEPARATE FROM THE MAYOR’S COALITION AS WELL WHERE WE’VE TALKED ABOUT WHAT’S GOING ON ON THE GROUND THEY REPORT TO ME I REPORT TO THEM. SO WE’VE BEEN IN TOUCH A FAIR AMOUNT. DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION? YEAH, I THINK SO. THANK YOU. AND THANKS FOR THE H-2A. I GUESS BROUGHT A CONFLICTING REPORTS. WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT INDICATES ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WHETHER THAT WILL BE ACTIVATED. GREAT AND NEXT UP IS KIT HAIRY KID HARRISON FROM I’M JUMBO AFRICA. GO AHEAD KIT. HI DOCTORS, AND LAST WEEK YOU SHARED YOUR CONCERN ABOUT SOME STARK DATA FROM CHICAGO TO DETROIT SOME OTHER CITIES THE INDICATE THAT THE TOTALITY RANGE FROM THE COVID VIRUS OR MUCH HIGHER AMONG PEOPLE OF COLOR THAN IN THE US. YOU ALSO SAID STELLA. SEEING THOSE DISPARITIES IN MAINE WHICH MAKES IT SOUND LIKE THE CDC IS TRACKING CASES BY RACE AND MAN. WHAT DOES THE DATA SHOW HERE? SO KIDS QUESTION IS ABOUT WHAT WE’VE SEEN IN OUR DATA WITH RESPECT TO ANY RACIAL INEQUITIES OR DISPARITIES AND KIT YOU’RE CORRECT. ONE OF OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES IN PUBLIC HEALTH GENERALLY AND CERTAINLY WITHIN THE STATE IS KEEPING A SHARP FOCUS ON HEALTH EQUITY AT ALL TIMES WHETHER THAT’S IN AN OUTBREAK SETTING OR A NUN OUTBREAK SETTING AND AS WE’VE SEEN FROM OTHER CITIES AND STATES. THERE ARE HIGHLY DISTURBING TRENDS THAT ARE BEGINNING TO EMERGE WITH RESPECT TO THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT THAT COVID-19 HAS ON POOR AND MINORITY POPULATIONS. WE HAVEN’T REALLY SEEN THOSE TRENDS. MARRIAGE YET IN MAN, BUT IT’S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THOSE TRENDS REALLY ONLY EMERGED IN OTHER STATES AND CITIES WHEN THEY HAD MULTIPLE THOUSANDS OF CASES RIGHT NOW SITTING WHERE WE ARE. IT IS REALLY TOO EARLY TO DRAW ANY TRENDS OR ANY CONCLUSIONS ABOUT DISPARITIES WHETHER THEY BE BY RACE OR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS IN NEW ORLEANS IN CHICAGO IN DETROIT. THOSE TRENDS ONLY EMERGED AFTER THEY SAW SEVERAL SEVERAL. THOUSANDS OF CASES. SO WE WHILE WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE OUT FOR THOSE. WE DON’T HAVE A SUFFICIENT SAMPLE SIZE AT THIS TIME TO DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. LET’S HOPE WE DON’T SEE THOSE TRENDS REPLICATE OURSELVES THEMSELVES IN MAINE, BUT AS I’VE SAID BEFORE HOPES NOT A STRATEGY IN THIS SITUATION, AND WE’RE GOING TO CONTINUE LOOKING AT THE DATA. THAT’S ALL THE QUESTIONS WE’VE GOT FOR TODAY. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US. WE LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING WITH EVERYONE TOMORROW. THANK YOU, AND I WILL JUST SAY ONE MORE TIME. I REPEAT MYSELF, BUT I IT’S WORTH SAYING AGAIN STAY THE COURSE. STAY HOME. STAY APART IN ORDER TO TO BE A PART OF THE COMMUNITY AGAIN SOMETIME SOON. I THINK THE NUMBERS WERE SEEING EVERY DAY WHILE THEY’RE A BIT DISCOURAGING. THEY ARE DISCOURAGING COMPARED TO SOME OTHER STATES, YOU KNOW, WE FEEL NOT BAD ABOUT THE NUMBERS AS BAD AS WE MIGHT OTHERWISE FEELING LIKE IT WAS YOGI. BERRA SAID IT AIN’T TILL IT’S OVER. WELL, IT AIN’T OVER TILL IT’S OVER. LET’S STICK WITH US. STAY HOME. STAY APART. WE’LL GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. THANK YOU. GOVERNOR JANET MILLS AND DR. SHAH FROM THE MAINE CDC GIVING THE DAILY UPDATE THE BIG HEADLINE HERE TODAY WAS FROM GOVERNOR MILLS WHO ANNOUNCED THAT SHE IS EXTENDING THIS CIVIL STATE OF EMERGENCY ORDER FOR ANOTHER 30 DAYS. IT WAS DUE TO EXPIRE TOMORROW. IT WILL NOW RUN THROUGH MAY 15TH. NOW IT’S SEPARATE FROM THE STAY-AT-HOME ORDER THAT RIGHT NOW IS SCHEDULED AT THE END OF THIS MONTH THE GOVERNOR SAYING THEY WILL RE-EVALUATE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN THE DAYS TO COME IN TERMS OF THE LATEST NUMBERS HERE IF WE COULD PULL THOSE UP FOR YOU RIGHT HERE. 734 CONFIRMED CASES THAT IS UP 36 FROM MONDAY THE BULK OF THOSE HAVE BEEN IN CUMBERLAND COUNTY AND THERE ARE NOW 20 DEATHS IN OUR STATE THAT IS UP ONE FROM MONDAY. SO THAT IS THE LATEST UPDATE FROM THE MAINE CDC. AND THE GOVERNOR. WE’RE GOING TO HAVE ALL THE LATEST FOR YOU ON THE DAY’S NEWS COMING UP FIRST AT 4:00 RIGHT HERE, BUT FOR NOW IT IS BACK TO REGULAR PROGRAMMING.

People are fearful and hunkering down at home. Now, perhaps more than ever, is the time for tech to shine and help things get back to normal and to prepare for a more successful, healthier and safer future.  The rapid spread of the coronavirus has thrown into disarray our vision of a connected digital world poised to solve any crisis through global communication and rapid response. We must acknowledge that despite the incredible advances our society has made as a result of technology, we nevertheless failed to spot the patterns of this pandemic before they spread. How humbling and disorienting.  The speed of rapid technological growth represented by Moore’s Law pales in comparison to the exponential growth of today’s invisible microscopic killer. After decades of speedy, shimmering progress, technology missed a lethal threat that has rattled lives, businesses and governments across the globe, and poses a significant threat to humanity.  Tragically, thousands of people have died and many more may follow. The pressure on hospitals and medical providers is immense. The pain of losing loved ones will scar the lives of those left behind. This is not what we expected when we rang in the New Year of 2020.  Governments are struggling to respond. China, Italy, France, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Australia, among others, have been criticised by some for being too strict. Great Britain is being criticised by some for being too lax. Spain is being criticised for stepping up too late. No one knows the truth about how Iran has been affected, though things sound dire. The United States is watching and learning and calibrating the response daily.  Through incredible advances in technology and industry we have been successful in shrinking and shaping our world to suit our needs. So many around the globe are able to enjoy any food in any season and drink fresh water or a plethora of beverages on demand. Many are able to travel the globe at a moment’s notice. We communicate across hemispheres at the swipe of a screen. We regard good health as a human right. We consume oil, gas, electricity and entertainment without a moment’s consideration.  For those among us who are fortunate to enjoy all of those privileges, much of it may be about to change. The future starts here. And it has the potential to look a bit like the past. Growing up, we found it a bit hard to relate when we heard of people from our parents’ generation postponing family gatherings and leaving the city in the summer to escape the polio epidemic that terrified Americans in the 1950s as surely as the threat of nuclear war terrified them in the 1960s. For our children, these concepts are even more foreign.  When this crisis is over, it will be hard for some to adjust to the new reality that despite what we think, the world is not in our control. Fear and uncertainty are nipping at our heels.  Businesses, schools, colleges and sports arenas have closed around the world. Millions of people are confined to their homes to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Millions of people will temporarily stop earning an income and countless businesses around the world may collapse. The medical infrastructures of many countries around the world are preparing for an influx of people who will require intensive care in hospitals, placing a huge burden on the medical system, equipment, drugs, doctors, nurses and other medical professionals.  To ensure we get back on track, and stay on the track as much as possible, there is now an urgent need for innovation. Technology can help us overcome many of the problems resulting from the crisis. The switch to digital will create a mass of vulnerabilities and challenges. Destructive cyber-jackals will swoop in even as our communities circle their digital wagons to protect themselves.  This worldwide crisis presents the greatest challenge yet faced by digital technology. This new struggle against an invisible threat will result in the creation of new areas of business activity. Some that exist already will expand dramatically: digital medicine; artificial intelligence-powered diagnostics; remote social and business networking; online freight and logistics; one-click cybersecurity and payment systems for small businesses; 3-D printing for vital medical equipment; training for distance learning – just to name a few. Other entirely new industries will appear.  Together we must plan for future pandemics because this story is just beginning. Society urgently needs mass testing capabilities, either through the worldwide licensing of successful technology that proves itself during this crisis, or the development of new, reliable and fast methods. We need technological solutions based on what we learn from this emergency.  We must look inward and ask ourselves the tough questions: could we have tracked the spread of the virus earlier? How do we track data more efficiently while still respecting privacy and civil liberties? Is that really possible, or must we sacrifice some privacy and liberty for the greater good of humanity? Can we deploy new technology so that epidemiologists forecast more accurately and physicians treat more effectively? What could we have done better?  At this pivotal moment of human history much may change. Entrepreneurs are uniquely skilled to provide fast, effective, efficient solutions to some of our greatest challenges. The tech world has the ingenuity, resources, imagination and drive to tackle these new challenges.  Humanity has been blessed with vast talent and skill including and, perhaps especially, among the world of science and technology.  So to those talented folks, we say that it is time to move fast and help us fix things. The future can be bright if we work together, quickly, efficiently, and as partners for all of humanity.

Palm Beach officials say they have observed no violations of town laws or emergency orders related to the operations of a temporary trading floor set up by a securities company owned by billionaire Ken Griffin at the otherwise vacant Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach.  As the coronavirus pandemic escalated, Citadel Securities booked the entire property on South Ocean Boulevard, a Citadel Securities spokesman confirmed this week to the Palm Beach Daily News  The company bills itself as one of the world’s largest traders of options, equities and foreign currency. It is separate from the Citadel hedge fund run by Griffin, who has a vacation home in Palm Beach.  The trading floor opened in a conference area of the hotel March 30, staffed by 24 employees from the company’s New York City and Chicago offices, company spokesman Zia Ahmed said. New York City and Chicago are both grappling with major outbreaks of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.  Bloomberg.com broke the story about the temporary location in Palm Beach on April 1, and the Palm Beach Daily News followed up immediately on the report.  Citadel Securities’ employees reside at the hotel and don’t leave the property, Ahmed said, adding that the set-up can be compared to a self-quarantine for the workers.  He told the Daily News the company had taken and continues to take measures to ensure the health and safety of its employees and hotel employees, including access to on-site medical care, if needed. Family members are staying with some of the employees at the hotel, 2800 S. Ocean Blvd., according to published reports.  Griffin is not staying at the hotel, Ahmed said.   Concerns raised  Several neighbors of the hotel have posted on social media and told officials that they have seen people on the resort’s property who didn’t appear to be maintaining social-distancing requirements.  The town addressed those concerns Tuesday in a post on its website.  \"We have responded recently to the Four Seasons for several Violations of Town Ordinance complaints, but to date have not observed a citable violation,\" the post said. \"We will continue to respond as necessary to ensure the safety and comfort of all of the residents and visitors to Palm Beach.\"  The town’s statement also said: \"After looking into the concerns, we have confirmed to the best of our ability that none of the state, county or town emergency orders have been violated, to include the self-quarantine order for travelers from specified locations.\"  Ahmed said it took about a week to put the plan for the trading floor together. The arrangements were finalized days before the county issued its ban on new hotel reservations on March 26, Ahmed said.  The company is appreciative of the efforts from local vendors to get the site operational so quickly, Ahmed added.  The company’s decision to set up the temporary trading floor was sanctioned by regulators of the trading industry whose goal is to ensure orderly markets, Ahmed said. He described the trading floor at the Four Seasons as similar to the off-site facilities that financial firms set up after disasters.  He described the Palm Beach operations as a \"business continuity initiative\" to ensure that the company’s operations could continue uninterrupted during the crisis and help provide liquidity to the financial markets. The company serves institutional and retail clients.  Palm Beach Police Public Information Officer Michael Ogrodnick told the New York Times this week that the town considers the hotel, in this instance, identical to a private home, where residents can work and enjoy the property, including any recreational facilities that remain open for use.  \"As far as we’re concerned, they’re in their own bubble,\" Ogrodnick told the Times.   Room-service available  The Four Seasons stopped taking reservations a couple of weeks ago, as a spokeswoman confirmed to the Daily News on March 27, the day after Palm Beach County issued its ban on new hotel reservations from the general public.  The resort is \"offering reduced services to those guests who are currently on the property,\" Four Seasons spokeswoman Laurie Herrick said in an email Wednesday. \"We have undertaken additional and extensive precautionary measures to ensure the health, safety and well-being of everyone at the resort.\"  The Four Seasons is \"grateful,\" Herrick added, that the new occupants \"put their trust\" in the resort and allowed it to \"continue employment with 180 valued (resort workers) and support our local business suppliers.\"  Although the restaurants at the resort are closed, take-out options and in-room dining are available to those on site, she said.  \"Our employees have been trained on social-distancing measures to reduce face-to-face interactions,\" she added.  RELATED: Ken Griffin squares off massive Palm Beach estate with $99M house buy, sources say  Griffin has a vacation home on South Ocean Boulevard, down the road from the hotel. His massive estate is the largest in Palm Beach and measures more than 20 acres of mostly vacant land. It lies about a quarter-mile south of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago.  Although hotels in the county can’t accept new reservations from the general public, the county’s emergency order lets them provide accommodations to so-called \"critical lodgers.\" Those are people whose work has been deemed essential to combating the health crisis or who meet other criteria outlined in the emergency order.  >> Read the Shiny Sheet for the latest on the coronavirus  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 15, "joy": 11, "negative": 6, "positive": 24, "fear": 9, "trust": 11}, "metadata": ["coronavirus", "violations", "billionaire", "pandemic", "spokesman", "staffed", "ensure", "media", "crisis", "michael", "precautionary", "valued", "donald"]}, {"text": "As the new coronavirus spreads and sickens more people in the USA, people with preexisting health conditions are at particular risk, public health officials say.  Actor Tom Hanks, who revealed that he was living with Type 2 diabetes in 2013, confirmed Wednesday that he and his wife tested positive for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  People with diabetes are among those at increased risk for complications from COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.  That's because fluctuations in blood glucose levels and possible diabetes complications can make it harder to treat a viral infection, the International Diabetes Federation says.  Why someone with diabetes is at more risk for COVID-19  Though doctors are still learning what exactly puts someone at higher risk for developing a severe illness with COVID-19, early information indicates older patients and those with chronic medical conditions may be at higher risk.  According to early data from more than 44,000 confirmed cases in China as of Feb 11, deaths among patients who had diabetes were at 7%, compared with 0.9% for those without an underlying condition, the CDC says.  According to the International Diabetes Federation, there may be two reasons for the complications that can arise.  \"Firstly, the immune system is compromised, making it harder to fight the virus and likely leading to a longer recovery period,\" the group wrote in its \"Diabetes Voice\" publication. \"Secondly, the virus may thrive in an environment of elevated blood glucose.\"  \"Diabetes affects healing in general,\" said Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist at Duke University. Patients who have diabetes can have an increased risk of taking more time to heal and get a secondary infection, Spratt said.  People with diabetes can't make enough or can't as effectively use the insulin in their bodies, according to the CDC. Insulin helps people use sugar in their bloodstreams for energy. As the food we eat breaks down into sugar, or glucose, it is released into our blood, and our pancreas releases insulin to facilitate the process.  \"When there isn’t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss and kidney disease,\" the CDC says.  When a patient's diabetes is uncontrolled, meaning blood sugar levels are not in a recommended range, this can especially contribute to heart or kidney problems, said Dr. Maria Peña, director of endocrine services at Mount Sinai Doctors Forest Hills in New York.  Having both problems with their heart or kidney and diabetes could worsen the prognosis for patients with COVID-19, she said.  Another potential issue for patients with diabetes amid the COVID-19 outbreak is inflammation, said Peña.  Increased blood sugar can increase inflammation, as can viral infections, Peña said. With both increasing inflammation, this can increase the likelihood of a more severe complication, she added.  People with diabetes, even those with the condition well managed, are at a higher risk of complications from the flu as well, the CDC says.  Patients with Type 1 diabetes, caused when a person's immune system attacks the cells in their pancreas that create insulin, are at an increased risk for diabetic ketoacidosis. \"This can make fluid and electrolyte management even trickier when trying to manage sepsis,\" Spratt said.  According to research published Wednesday in the medical journal The Lancet, sepsis and septic shock are among the severe complications observed in some COVID-19 cases.  What should people with diabetes do to prepare?  The CDC recommends people with preexisting conditions take everyday precautions to protect themselves from COVID-19. This includes avoiding contact with sick people, washing their hands regularly and not touching their face, among other measures.  Those who have a condition such as diabetes should make sure they're in contact with their doctor if they need extra medication or supplies, such as test strips or insulin.  The American Diabetes Association recommends gathering simple carbs such as regular soda, honey, jam, Jell-O, hard candies or popsicles.  \"If you have diabetes and you have symptoms such as cough, high temperature and feeling short of breath, you need to monitor your blood sugar closely,\" Dan Howarth, head of care at Diabetes UK, said in a statement.
